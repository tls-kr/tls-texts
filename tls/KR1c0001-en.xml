The phrase "there is a fox walking slowly" (cautiously, slyly) occurs almostale fox walks slowly") in ode 101, and there obviously it symbolizes the sly man who has managed, by his clever plans, to marry a young lady, to the despair of her true lover. Probably the metaphor is the same here, and the ode would then be an expression of pity with a young and poor girl who has no means of resisting the "fox" who slyly wants to catch her: being quite destitute, she has to accept what marriage can be offered.</seg>

A dignitary(da fu) married one first-rank wife and two secondary wives. In our ode here, such a nobleman expresses his delight at the three fine girls he receives. The "bundled firewood" is a standing metaphor for the cohesion and solidarity of the family, see odes 68, 92 above, and here it alludes to the new family constituted. The Three Stars is the name of a constellation (the comm. identify it varyingly), and of course symbolizes the three beautiful girls.</seg>
