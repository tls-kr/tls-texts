<p>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-550a.14" xml:lang="en">because Ly Chan and the other members of the Ly clan</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-550a.15" xml:lang="en">were threatening to endanger the position of the Liu family by starting a revolt,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-550a.16" xml:lang="en">the great ministers joined in overthrowing them</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-550a.17" xml:lang="en">and laid plans to summon the king of Dai to take the throne.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-550a.18" xml:lang="en">(An account of the affair will be found in the chapter on Empress Ly.)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.2" xml:lang="en">The chancellor Chen Ping, the grand commandant Zhou Bo, and the others sent an envoy to fetch the king of Dai.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.3" xml:lang="en">The king consulted Zhang Wu, his chief of palace attendants, and others of his court,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.4" xml:lang="en">and in the course of the debate they expressed their opinion as follows:</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.5" xml:lang="en">"The great ministers of the Han were all originally generals in the time of Emperor Gao-zu.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.6" xml:lang="en">They are experienced in warfare</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.7" xml:lang="en">and given to plots and deceits.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.8" xml:lang="en">There is more behind their proposal than simply this.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.9" xml:lang="en">In the past they have been restrained only by their awe of Emperor Gao-zu and Empress Ly,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.10" xml:lang="en">but now they have succeeded in wiping out the Ly clan</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.11" xml:lang="en">and have newly tasted blood in the capital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.12" xml:lang="en">They say that They have come to fetch Your Majesty,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.13" xml:lang="en">but in truth they cannot by trusted.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.14" xml:lang="en">We beg you not to go, but to put them off with an excuse of illness</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.15" xml:lang="en">and wait to see how the situation develops."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.16" xml:lang="en">The military commander Song Chang then came forward and spoke:</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.17" xml:lang="en">"The opinion of the courtiers is utterly wrong!"</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.18" xml:lang="en">When the Qin lost control of the government,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.19" xml:lang="en">the feudal lords and local heroes sprang up on all sides in inestimable numbers,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.20" xml:lang="en">each one believing that he could become ruler.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.21" xml:lang="en">But it was a member of the Liu family</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.22" xml:lang="en">who in the end succeeded in stepping into the position of Son of Heaven,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.23" xml:lang="en">and with that the hopes of the rest of the world came to an end.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.24" xml:lang="en">This is the first point to be noted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.25" xml:lang="en">"Emperor Gao-zu made kings of his sons and brothers</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.26" xml:lang="en">and laid out their territories so that they interlocked like the teeth of a dog.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.27" xml:lang="en">His may be called a house set on a firm rock,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.28" xml:lang="en">and the world has bowed before its might.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.29" xml:lang="en">This is the second point.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.30" xml:lang="en">"When the Han arose</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.31" xml:lang="en">it abolished the harsh administration of the Qin,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.32" xml:lang="en">simplified the laws and ordinances,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.33" xml:lang="en">and ruled with virtue and kindness</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.34" xml:lang="en">so that all men are now at peace</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.35" xml:lang="en">and cannot easily be roused to action.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.36" xml:lang="en">This is the third point.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.37" xml:lang="en">"Because of the authority she wielded,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.38" xml:lang="en">Empress Ly was able to make kings of three of her family,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.39" xml:lang="en">exercising power as she pleased and dominating the government.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.40" xml:lang="en">And yet with a single set of credentials Zhou Bo entered the northern garrison,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.41" xml:lang="en">and he had only to give a single cry when the soldiers all bared their left arms</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.42" xml:lang="en">and declared themselves loyal to the Liu family,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.43" xml:lang="en">so that he turned upon the Ly clan</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.44" xml:lang="en">and in the end annihilated it.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.45" xml:lang="en">Thus it is that the throne is bestowed by Heaven</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.46" xml:lang="en">and cannot be won by human strength alone!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.47" xml:lang="en">"Now, although the great ministers might hope to revolt against the Liu family,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.48" xml:lang="en">the common people would never support them,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.49" xml:lang="en">nd indeed it is doubtful that they could even reach agreement within their own party.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.50" xml:lang="en">They are restrained by your own kinsmen Liu Zhang and Liu Xing-ju who reside in the capital,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.51" xml:lang="en">and they fear the power of the kings of Wu, Chu, Huai-nan, Lang-ya, Qi, and Dai in the provinces beyond.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.52" xml:lang="en">"Of the sons of Emperor Gao-zu there remain today only the king of Huai-nan and Your Majesty.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.53" xml:lang="en">Moreover, you are the elder,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.54" xml:lang="en">and your wisdom and goodness</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.55" xml:lang="en">are known throughout the empire.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.56" xml:lang="en">It is for this reason that the great ministers, according with the wishes of the world, have come to fetch you and desire you to take the throne.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.57" xml:lang="en">You need not doubt their intentions!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.58" xml:lang="en">The king of Dai informed his mother of the matter and they discussed what to do,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.59" xml:lang="en">but hesitated and came to no decision.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.60" xml:lang="en">Then the king divined by the tortoise shell</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.61" xml:lang="en">and the lines obtained indicated the "Great Transversal,"</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.62" xml:lang="en">the interpretation of which reads:</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.63" xml:lang="en">Grosswise the lines of the Great Transversal!</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.64" xml:lang="en">I shall become a heavenly king</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.65" xml:lang="en">Like Qi of the Xia who brought glory!57</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.66" xml:lang="en">"But surely I am a king already,"</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.67" xml:lang="en">exclaimed the king of Dai.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.68" xml:lang="en">"How should I become a king again?"</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.69" xml:lang="en">"The words 'heavenly king,'" replied the diviner,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.70" xml:lang="en">"refer to the Son of Heaven!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.71" xml:lang="en">With this the king of Dai dispatched Bo Zhao, his mother's younger brother, to go to the capital to see Zhou Bo.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.72" xml:lang="en">Zhou Bo and the others explained to him their reasons for wishing to fetch the king of Dai and make him ruler.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.73" xml:lang="en">Bo Zhao returned and reported on the interview.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.74" xml:lang="en">"They speak in good faith.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.75" xml:lang="en">There is no need to mistrust them!"</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.76" xml:lang="en">The king turned to Song Chang with a laugh and said,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.77" xml:lang="en">"It was indeed just as you said!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.78" xml:lang="en">Then he ordered Song Chang to join him in his carriage and,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.79" xml:lang="en">accompanied by Zhang Wu and the others, six men in all, he journeyed by relay carriage to Chang-an.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.80" xml:lang="en">When he reached Gao-ling he stopped to rest,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-551a.81" xml:lang="en">sending Song Chang adead to abserve the situation in the capital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-552a.2" xml:lang="en">When Song Chang reached the bridge over the Wei River</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-552a.3" xml:lang="en">he found that the chancellor and the lesser officials had all come out to welcome the king.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-552a.4" xml:lang="en">Song Chang returned to report the situation to the king,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-552a.5" xml:lang="en">who hastened as far as the Wei Bridge,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-552a.6" xml:lang="en">where the host of officials bowed in greeting, acknowledging themselves his subjects.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-552a.7" xml:lang="en">The king descended from his carriage and bowed in return.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-552a.8" xml:lang="en">The grand commandant Zhou Bo then came forward.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-552a.9" xml:lang="en">"I beg to have a word in private," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-552a.10" xml:lang="en">"If you would speak of public affairs,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-552a.11" xml:lang="en">speak of them in public!"</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-552a.12" xml:lang="en">said Song Chang.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-552a.15" xml:lang="en">Zhou Bo thereupon knelt and presented the seals and credentials of the Son of Heaven,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-552a.16" xml:lang="en">but the king declined to accept them, saying,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_010-552a.18" xml:lang="en">The king hastened to the state residence of Dai,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-1a.13" xml:lang="en">Qin's customs were mixed with those of the Rong and Di barbarians.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-1a.14" xml:lang="en">It put vilence and cruelty first</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-1a.15" xml:lang="en">and benevolence and righteousness last,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-1a.16" xml:lang="en">and though it occupied the position of a vassal state, it carried out suburban sacrifices in the manner of the Son of Heaven.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-1a.17" xml:lang="en">It is enough to fill a grentleman with fear!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-1a.18" xml:lang="en">Later Duke Wen advanced beyond Long</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-1a.19" xml:lang="en">and drove back the Yi and Di barbarians,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-1a.20" xml:lang="en">paid honour to the Treasures of Chen,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-1a.21" xml:lang="en">and set up his capital between Mt. Qi and Yong.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-1a.22" xml:lang="en">Duke Mu applied himself to government</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-1a.23" xml:lang="en">and extended his territory east to the Yellow River,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-1a.24" xml:lang="en">becoming an equal of the lords of the Central Kingdom such as Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Wen of Jin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-1a.25" xml:lang="en">After this, government passed into the hands of the ministerial families,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-1a.26" xml:lang="en">the grandees held their posts for generation after generation,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-1a.27" xml:lang="en">and the six high ministers of Jin usurped authority,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-1a.28" xml:lang="en">carrying out punitive expeditions and meeting to conclude oaths of alliance,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-1a.29" xml:lang="en">their authority outweighing that of the feudal rulers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-1a.30" xml:lang="en">In time Tian Chang assassinated his sovereign Duke Jian and became prime minister of the state of Qi,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-1a.31" xml:lang="en">while the other feudal rulers sat by passively and failed to punish him,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-1a.32" xml:lang="en">until all within the seas were contending for military supremacy.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-1a.33" xml:lang="en">So the three ministerial families in the end divided up the state of Jin among themselves,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-1a.34" xml:lang="en">and Tian He wipes put the Qi ruling family and took possession of the state.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-1a.35" xml:lang="en">This marked the beginning of the era when the Six State flourished.2</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-1a.36" xml:lang="en">All efforts were directed at strengthening arms and ennexing rivals.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-1a.37" xml:lang="en">Plots and deceptions came into use, and men appeared who argued for the vertical or horizontal alliances or pointed out the strong or weak points of such alliances.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-1a.38" xml:lang="en">False titles sprang up like bees,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-1a.39" xml:lang="en">vows and covenants could bot be trusted,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-1a.40" xml:lang="en">and though men exchanged hostages and split tallies, there was no way to enforce promises and agreements.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-1a.41" xml:lang="en">Qin began as a small state situated in a far-off region,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-1a.42" xml:lang="en">shunned by the Xia lineage states</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-1a.43" xml:lang="en">and classed with the Rong and Di barbarians.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-1a.44" xml:lang="en">But after the time of Duke Xian, it was always a leader among the feudal rulers.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-1a.45" xml:lang="en">Qin at its most virtuous and righteous could not compare tou and Wey at their most violent and cruel,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-1a.46" xml:lang="en">and its military strength was no match for that of the Three Jing states.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-1a.47" xml:lang="en">Yet in the end it united the whole world under its rule.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-1a.48" xml:lang="en">This was not necessarily due to its mountain barriers or the advantages of its geographic situation.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-1a.49" xml:lang="en">Rather it was as though Heaven had aided it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-2a.2" xml:lang="en">It is sometimes said that things first come to life in the east</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-2a.3" xml:lang="en">and reach their fulfilment in the west.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-2a.4" xml:lang="en">The beginning of an undertaking invariably occurs in the southeast,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-2a.5" xml:lang="en">and the reaping of rewards always takes place in the northwest.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-2a.6" xml:lang="en">Hence Emperor Yu arose among the Western Qiang tribes,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-2a.7" xml:lang="en">King Tang had his start in Bo,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-2a.8" xml:lang="en">the Zhou leaders became kings when from their capital at Feng and Hao they attacked the Yin dynasty,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-2a.9" xml:lang="en">Qin became emperor by using Yongzhou as a base,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-2a.10" xml:lang="en">and Han came to power from Han in Shu.3</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-3a.2" xml:lang="en">After the Qin had achieved its goal of unification,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-3a.3" xml:lang="en">it burned all the copies of the Odes and Documents in the empire,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-3a.4" xml:lang="en">along with the historical records of the various feudal rulers, numerous as they were,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-3a.5" xml:lang="en">because they contained sharp criticisms of the Qin.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-3a.6" xml:lang="en">The reason the Odes and Documents have reappeared</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-3a.7" xml:lang="en">is that many copies were stored away in people's houses.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-3a.8" xml:lang="en">But the historical records were stored only in the Zhou archives,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-3a.9" xml:lang="en">and hence were all destroyed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-3a.10" xml:lang="en">How regrettable!</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-3a.11" xml:lang="en">How regrettable!</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-3a.12" xml:lang="en">All we have left are the Qin historical records,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-3a.13" xml:lang="en">though they do not record days and months</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-3a.14" xml:lang="en">and the text is sketchy and incomplete.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-3a.15" xml:lang="en">Nevertheless, there are things worth noting even in the shifts of power of the Warring States period.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-3a.16" xml:lang="en">Why must one learn only from high antiquity?</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-3a.17" xml:lang="en">Qin's seizure of the empire was accompanied by much violence,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-3a.18" xml:lang="en">yet it managed to change with the times</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-3a.19" xml:lang="en">and its accomplishments were great.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-3a.20" xml:lang="en">A certain text tells us to "model ourselves on the rulers of later times"4</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-3a.21" xml:lang="en">Why?</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-3a.22" xml:lang="en">Because they were closer to us, their customs and the happenings of their times resemble ours,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-3a.23" xml:lang="en">and their ideals are lowly and easy to practise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-3a.24" xml:lang="en">Scholars, influenced by what they have heard,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-3a.25" xml:lang="en">see that the Qin occupied the position of emperor for only a short period,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-3a.26" xml:lang="en">and they fail to examine the beginning and end of the matter.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-3a.27" xml:lang="en">Hence they refer to the Qin only as an object of ridicule</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-3a.28" xml:lang="en">and decline to say anything more about it.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-3a.29" xml:lang="en">This is as ridiculous as trying to eat with one's ear,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-4a.1" xml:lang="en">and lamentable indeed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-4a.3" xml:lang="en">I have accordingly followed the Qin annals,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-4a.4" xml:lang="en">beginning shortly after the Spring and Autumn period</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-4a.5" xml:lang="en">with the reign of King Yuan of the Zhou (476-469 BC).</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-4a.6" xml:lang="en">I have made a chronological table of the events of the Six States</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-4a.7" xml:lang="en">down to the time of the Second Emperor,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-4a.8" xml:lang="en">a period of 270 years in all,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-4a.9" xml:lang="en">recording the beginnings of success and failure as they have been reported.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-4a.10" xml:lang="en">I hope in future times there will be gentlemen</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_015-5a.1" xml:lang="en">who will peruse my work.</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_028-127a.5" xml:lang="en">Accordingly theTemples of the Five Emperors were constructed north of the Wei River.</seg>

</p>
<p>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_028-132a.4" xml:lang="en">Another time Xinyuan Ping announced that, according to his observations,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_028-132a.6" xml:lang="en">After a little while</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_028-132a.7" xml:lang="en">the sun began to move backward until it had returned to the meridian.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_028-132a.8" xml:lang="en">Thereupon the emperor began to number the years of his reign over again,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_028-132a.10" xml:lang="en">and ordered great feasting throughout the empire.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_028-133a.2" xml:lang="en">Next Xinyuan Ping announced,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_028-133a.10" xml:lang="en">The emperor therefore sent envoys to build a temple at Fenyin,</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_028-134a.2" xml:lang="en">At this time someone sent a letter revealing to the emperor</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_028-134a.8" xml:lang="en">the emperor lost interest in changing the calendar</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_028-135a.2" xml:lang="en">He ordered his sacrificial officials to see to the upkeep</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_028-136a.2" xml:lang="en">The following year</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_028-136a.6" xml:lang="en">A few years later Emperor Jing ascended the throne.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_028-136a.7" xml:lang="en">During the sixteen years of his reign</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_028-139a.4" xml:lang="en">These men wished to begin discussions on the establishment of a Bright Hall south of the capital,</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_028-150a.2" xml:lang="en">When Li Shaojun appeared before the emperor,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_028-150a.3" xml:lang="en">the latter questioned him about a ancient bronze vessel</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_028-151a.2" xml:lang="en">When the inscription on the vessel was deciphered,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_028-151a.3" xml:lang="en">it was found that it had in fact belonged to Duke Huan of Qi.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_028-151a.4" xml:lang="en">Everyone in the place was filled with astonishment</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_028-151a.5" xml:lang="en">and decided that Li Shaojun must be a spirit</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_028-152a.2" xml:lang="en">Li Shaojun then advised the emperor,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_028-152a.3" xml:lang="en">"If you sacrifice to the fireplace you can call the spirits to you,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_028-152a.10" xml:lang="en">This is what the Yellow Emperor did.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_028-153a.2" xml:lang="en">Once I wandered by the sea</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_028-153a.3" xml:lang="en">and visited Master Anqi,</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_028-154a.2" xml:lang="en">As a result, the emperor for the first time began to sacrifice in person to the fireplace.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_028-154a.3" xml:lang="en">He dispatched magicians to set out on the sea</seg>

<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_028-194a.2" xml:lang="en">The emperor in person went to visit the home of Luan Da</seg>

<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_028-195a.2" xml:lang="en">The emperor then had another jade seal carved with the title</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_028-195a.9" xml:lang="en">This was done to indicate that Luan Da was not being treated as a subject of the emperor.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_028-195a.10" xml:lang="en">The words "Heavenly Way" on the seal meant</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_028-200a.7" xml:lang="en">For this purpose he made a trip to the mountains,</seg>

<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_028-244a.2" xml:lang="en">The emperor therefore ordered the Confucian scholars</seg>

</p>
<p>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_028-245a.8" xml:lang="en">The Confucian scholars for their part had been unable</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_028-245a.10" xml:lang="en">Furthermore, they insisted upon confining themselves to what was written in the Odes and Documents and other old works and seemed incapable of coming forward with any worthwhile suggestions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_028-246a.2" xml:lang="en">When the emperor had sacrificial vessels made for use in the Feng and Shan</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-20a.2" xml:lang="en">Now if we were to dig a canal from the Wei River, beginning at Chang-an and following</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-20a.4" xml:lang="en">to the Yellow River, the distance could be reduced to somethhing over three hundred li.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-20a.5" xml:lang="en">We would have a much easier route</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-20a.6" xml:lang="en">for transporting grain,</seg>

<p>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-21a.4" xml:lang="en">Thus we could reduce the time and labor required to haul grain</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-21a.6" xml:lang="en">and obtain a higher yield."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-22a.2" xml:lang="en">Approving the plan,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-22a.3" xml:lang="en">the emperor ordered Xu Bo, a water engineer from Qi,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-22a.4" xml:lang="en">to plot the course of the transport canal and called up a force of twenty or thirty thousand laborers to do the digging.</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-22a.8" xml:lang="en">and proved extremely beneficial.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-22a.9" xml:lang="en">From this time on grain transport to the capital gradually increased,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-22a.10" xml:lang="en">while the people living along the canal were able to make considerable use of the water to irrigate their fields.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-23a.2" xml:lang="en">After this, Pan Xi, the governor of He-dong, said to the emperor,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-23a.3" xml:lang="en">"Every year over a million piculs of grain</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-23a.4" xml:lang="en">are transported to the capital from the area east of the mountains.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-23a.5" xml:lang="en">Since it is brought up the Yellow River, it must be shipped through the dangerous narrows at Di-zhu Mountain,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-23a.7" xml:lang="en">and in addition the cost of transportation is very high.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-23a.8" xml:lang="en">Now if we were to dig canals from the Fen River to irrigate the region of Pi-shand parts of Fen-yin,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-23a.9" xml:lang="en">and other canals from the Yellow River to irrigate P'u-p'o and the rest of Fen-yin,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-23a.10" xml:lang="en">I believe we could bring five thousand qing of land under cultivation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-24a.2" xml:lang="en">At present this region is nothing more than a strip of uncultivated land along the Yellow River</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-24a.4" xml:lang="en">if it were turned into irrigated fields,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-24a.5" xml:lang="en">I think it could be made to yield over two million piculs of grain.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-24a.6" xml:lang="en">this could be transported up the Wei River to the capital</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-24a.7" xml:lang="en">and would be no more expensive than grain produced in the area within the Pass.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-24a.8" xml:lang="en">It would then no longer be necessary to haul grain from the east past the dangerous part of the river at Di-zhu."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-25a.2" xml:lang="en">The emperor considered this a sound idea</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-25a.3" xml:lang="en">and called up a force of twenty or thirty thousand laborers who worked for several years digging canals and opening up the fields.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-25a.5" xml:lang="en">But the Yellow River changed its course</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-25a.6" xml:lang="en">so that the water did not flow into the canals properly</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-25a.7" xml:lang="en">and the farmers who worked the newly opened fields were unable to produce enough to repay the cost of planting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-26a.2" xml:lang="en">After some time, therefore,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-26a.3" xml:lang="en">the newly opened canals and fields in He-dong were abandoned</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-26a.4" xml:lang="en">and the area was turned over to settlers from the state of Yue.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-26a.5" xml:lang="en">What little revenue it produced was allotted to the privy treasury.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-27a.2" xml:lang="en">Following this, someone sent a letter to the throne proposing that a road be opened up between the Bao and Ye rivers, and that they be used to transport grain.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-27a.3" xml:lang="en">The emperor referred the proposal to the imperial secretary Zhang tang who,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-27a.4" xml:lang="en">after conducting an inquiry,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-27a.5" xml:lang="en">reported as follows:</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-27a.6" xml:lang="en">"At present anyone wishing to travel to the province of Shu must go over the Old Road,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-27a.7" xml:lang="en">a very long and roundabout route b</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-27a.8" xml:lang="en">eset with steep places.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-28a.2" xml:lang="en">Now if the Bao and Ye rivers were dredged and a road opened between them,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-28a.3" xml:lang="en">it would provide a much more level route</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-28a.4" xml:lang="en">and the distance could be reduced to four hundred li.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-28a.5" xml:lang="en">The Bao River runs into the Mian River</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-28a.6" xml:lang="en">and the Ye River runs into the Wei,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-28a.7" xml:lang="en">both of which can be used to transport grain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-29a.2" xml:lang="en">Therefore grain could be brought from Nan-yang up the Mian River and into the Bao,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-29a.3" xml:lang="en">and where the Bao ends it could be transported overland by carts</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-30a.2" xml:lang="en">Thus</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-30a.3" xml:lang="en">grain from Han-zhong could be brought to the capital.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-30a.4" xml:lang="en">At the same time, by making use of the Mian River, grain could be transported from east of the mountains in unlimited quantities</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-30a.5" xml:lang="en">and the route would be much more convenient than the present one up the Yellow River and through the narrows at Di-zhu.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-30a.6" xml:lang="en">Moreover, the region of the Bao and Ye is as rich in timber and bamboo</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-30a.7" xml:lang="en">as the provinces of Ba and shu."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-31a.2" xml:lang="en">The emperor approved the proposal</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-31a.3" xml:lang="en">and appointed Zhang Tang's son Zhang Ang as governor of Han-zhong,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-31a.4" xml:lang="en">calling up a force of twenty or thirty thousand laborers and setting them to work constructing the Bao and Ye road and waterway which extended more than five hundred li.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-31a.5" xml:lang="en">When the road was finished it did in fact prove to be much shorter and more convenient than the old route,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-31a.6" xml:lang="en">but the rivers were too full of rapids and boulders</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-31a.7" xml:lang="en">to be used for transporting grain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-32a.2" xml:lang="en">Following this, a man named Zhuang Xiong-pi reported to the emperor</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-32a.3" xml:lang="en">that the people of Lin-jin wished to dig a canal from the Luo River to be used to irrigate some ten thousand qing of land east of Chong-quan. The land in this area was brackish,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-32a.4" xml:lang="en">but the people believed that if it could be irrigated with water led in from the Luo River,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-32a.5" xml:lang="en">it could be made to produce ten piculs per acre.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-32a.6" xml:lang="en">The emperor therefore called up a labor force of over ten thousand men and set tnem to work digging a canal</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-33a.2" xml:lang="en">There, however, it was found that the banks of the canal kept collapsing,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-33a.3" xml:lang="en">so the men dug wells,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-33a.7" xml:lang="en">Thus the water disappeared from sight at Mount Shang-yan</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-33a.8" xml:lang="en">and flowed underground to the eastern side of the mountain, a distance of over ten li.</seg>

<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_029-36a.2" xml:lang="en">The emperor ordered Ji Ren and Guo Chang to raise a force of twenty or thirty thousand men and close the break in the banks of the Yellow River at Hu-zi,</seg>

<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-5a.2" xml:lang="en">In the time of Emperor Wen,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-5a.3" xml:lang="en">because the "elm-pod" coins, minted earlier, had grown too numerous</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-5a.5" xml:lang="en">new coins were cast weighing four zhu</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-5a.11" xml:lang="en">It was this wealth which he eventually used to start his revolt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-6a.2" xml:lang="en">Similarly, Deng Tong,</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-7a.2" xml:lang="en">At this time the Xiong-nu were making frequent raids across the northern border,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-7a.4" xml:lang="en">The grain produced by these garrisons alone, however, was not sufficient to feed all the border troops.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-7a.5" xml:lang="en">The government then called upon the people to supply grain, offering honorary ranks to those who were perpared to send grain to the frontier.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-7a.6" xml:lang="en">The ranks varied with the amount of grain but reached as high as the eighteenth rank, called da-shu-zhang.</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-8a.4" xml:lang="en">the order concerning the sale of ranks was revived,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-8a.6" xml:lang="en">In addition men who had been condemned to duty on the frontier for a year, together with the women of their families who were sentenced to menial service in the government workshops,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-8a.7" xml:lang="en">were permitted to buy off their sentences by transporting grain to the district officials.</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-9a.6" xml:lang="en">every person was well supplied and every family had enough to get along on.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-9a.7" xml:lang="en">The granaries in the cities and the countryside were full</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-10a.2" xml:lang="en">In the central granary of the government, new grain was heaped on top of the old</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-10a.4" xml:lang="en">where it spoiled and became unfit to eat.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-10a.5" xml:lang="en">Horses were to be seen even in the streets and lanes of the common people</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-10a.7" xml:lang="en">and anyone so poor as to have to ride a mare was disdained by his neighbors and not allowed to join the gatherings of the villagers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-11a.2" xml:lang="en">Even the keepers of the community gates ate fine grain and meat.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-11a.3" xml:lang="en">The local officials remained at the same posts long enough to see their sons and grandsons grow to manhood,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-11a.4" xml:lang="en">and the higher officials occupied the same positions so long that they adopted their official titles as surnames.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-11a.5" xml:lang="en">As a result, men had a sense of self-respect and regarded it as a serious matter to break the law.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-11a.6" xml:lang="en">Their first concern was to act in accordance with what was right and to avoid shame and dishonor.</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-12a.3" xml:lang="en">because the net of the law was slack and the people rich,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-12a.4" xml:lang="en">it was possible for men to use their wealth to exploit others and to accumulate huge fortunes.</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-80a.9" xml:lang="en">Zhang Tang sent a memorial to the throne relating this affair and stating, "Yan Yi, one of the nine highest ministers, having seen that the law was impractical,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-113a.4" xml:lang="en">Bu Shi was degraded to the post of grand tutor to the heir apparent.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-113a.5" xml:lang="en">Sang Hong-yang was amde secretary in charge of grain</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-113a.6" xml:lang="en">and put in control of the ministry of agriculture,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-113a.7" xml:lang="en">as well as taking over from Kong Jin complete supervision of the salt and iron monopolies throughout the empire.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-114a.2" xml:lang="en">Sang Hong-yang believed that the reason</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-114a.3" xml:lang="en">prices had risen so sharply</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-114a.4" xml:lang="en">was that the various government officials were engaging in trade and competing against each other.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-114a.5" xml:lang="en">Furthermore, when goods were transported to the capital as payment for taxes from various parts of the empire, their value often did not equal the cost of transportation.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-114a.6" xml:lang="en">He therefore propsed that some twenty or thirty assistants be appointed to the ministry of agriculture</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-114a.7" xml:lang="en">who would be sent out to supervise the various provinces and kingdoms,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-114a.8" xml:lang="en">where they would travel about and set up the necessary transport offices for equalizing prices, as well as salt and iron offices.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-114a.9" xml:lang="en">In the case of distant regions, orders were to be given that local products commanding a high price, such as would ordinarily be carted away and sold by the traders in other regions, should be transported to the capital in lieu of taxes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-115a.2" xml:lang="en">In the capital a balanced standard office was to be set up</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-115a.3" xml:lang="en">which would receive and store these goods brought in from various parts of the empire.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-115a.4" xml:lang="en">The government artisans were to be ordered to make carts and other equipment needed to put the system into effect.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-115a.5" xml:lang="en">All expenses would be borne by the ministry of agriculture,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-115a.6" xml:lang="en">whose officials would then have complete control over all the goods in the empire,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-115a.7" xml:lang="en">selling when prices were high</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-115a.8" xml:lang="en">and buying when they were low.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-116a.2" xml:lang="en">In this way</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-116a.3" xml:lang="en">the wealthy merchants and large-scale traders, deprived of any prospect of making big profits,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-116a.4" xml:lang="en">would go back to farming,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-116a.5" xml:lang="en">and it would become impossible for any commodity to jump in price.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-116a.6" xml:lang="en">Because the price of goods would thereby be controlled throughout the empire,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-116a.7" xml:lang="en">the system was to be called the "balanced standard."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-117a.2" xml:lang="en">The emperor agreed with this idea</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-117a.3" xml:lang="en">and gave permission for it to be put into effect.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-117a.4" xml:lang="en">Following this, the emperor traveled north as far as Suo-fang;</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-117a.5" xml:lang="en">from there he proceeded to Mount Tai,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-117a.6" xml:lang="en">journeyed along the seacoast</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-117a.7" xml:lang="en">and the northern border, and returned to the capital.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-117a.8" xml:lang="en">He handed out gifts and awards to the places he visited along the way,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-117a.9" xml:lang="en">doling out over a million rolls of silk</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-117a.10" xml:lang="en">as well as cash and gold in the jundred of millions,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-117a.11" xml:lang="en">all of which the ministry of agriculture was able to supply.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-118a.2" xml:lang="en">Sang Hong-yang proposed that petty officials be allowed to buy office by presenting grain to the government,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-118a.3" xml:lang="en">and that men accused of crimes be permitted to purchase their ransom in the same way.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-118a.4" xml:lang="en">He also suggested that the common people be allowed to present varying quantities of grain to the granary at Sweet Springs</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-118a.5" xml:lang="en">in exchange for lifetime exemption from military service</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-118a.6" xml:lang="en">and guarantees that they would not be subject to accusations leading toonfiscation of their wealth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-119a.2" xml:lang="en">Areas that were in need were immediately supplied by shipments of grain from other provinces,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-119a.3" xml:lang="en">and the various officials of the ministry of agriculture all drew grain from east of the mountains,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-119a.4" xml:lang="en">so that the amount transported to the capital increased to six million piculs annually.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-119a.5" xml:lang="en">Within a year</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-119a.6" xml:lang="en">the granary at Tai-cang in the capital and that at Sweet Springs had been filled,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-119a.7" xml:lang="en">the frontiers enjoyed a surplus of grain and other goods, and the transportation offices had five million rolls of silk.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-119a.8" xml:lang="en">Though taxes on the people had not been increased, there was now more than enough to cover the expenditures of the empire.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-119a.9" xml:lang="en">As a result Sang Hong-yang was rewarded with the rank of zuo-shu-zhang</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-119a.10" xml:lang="en">and once more presented with a hundred catties of gold.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-120a.2" xml:lang="en">This year there was a minor drought</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-120a.3" xml:lang="en">and the emperor ordered the officials to pray for rain.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-120a.4" xml:lang="en">Bu Shi remarked to the emperor,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-120a.5" xml:lang="en">"The district officials are supposed to collect what taxes they need for their food and clothing, and that is all!</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-120a.6" xml:lang="en">Now Sang Hong-yang has them sitting in the market stalls</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-120a.7" xml:lang="en">buying and selling goods and scrambling for a profit.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-120a.8" xml:lang="en">If Your Majesty were to boil Sang Hong-yang alive,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_020-731a.1" xml:lang="en">then I think Heaven might send us rain!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-121a.2" xml:lang="en">The Grand Historian remarks:</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-121a.3" xml:lang="en">When the farmers, the artisans, and the merchants first began to exchange articles among themselves,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-121a.4" xml:lang="en">that was when currency came into being--tortoise shells and sea shells, gold and copper coins, knife-shaped money and spade-shaped money.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-121a.5" xml:lang="en">Thus its origin is very old.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-121a.6" xml:lang="en">Concerning the time of Emperor Kū9 and the ages before him</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-121a.7" xml:lang="en">we can say nothing, for they are too far away.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-122a.2" xml:lang="en">The Book of Documents, however, tells us something about the reigns of Emperors Yan and Shun,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-122a.3" xml:lang="en">while the Book of Odes describes the Shang and Zhou dynasties.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-122a.4" xml:lang="en">Thus we know that in times of peace and security, stress was laid upon the system of schools;</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-122a.5" xml:lang="en">agricultural pursuits, which are the basis of the nation, were honored; secondary occupations such as trade were disparaged,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-122a.6" xml:lang="en">and the people were taught a sense of propriety and duty in order to discourage them from the search for profit.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-122a.7" xml:lang="en">In periods of war and unrest, however, the opposite situation prevailed.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-122a.8" xml:lang="en">When a thing has reached its height it must begin to decay,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-122a.9" xml:lang="en">and when an age has gone to one extreme it must turn again in the opposite direction;</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-122a.10" xml:lang="en">therefore we find periods of rude simplicity and periods of refinement</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-122a.11" xml:lang="en">alternating with each other endlessly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-123a.2" xml:lang="en">From the description of the nine provinces in the "Tribute of Yu"20 we learn that,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-123a.3" xml:lang="en">in the time of that ruler, each region submitted as its tribute to the throne whatever goods it was best fitted to produce</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-123a.4" xml:lang="en">and whatever the people had the most of.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-123a.5" xml:lang="en">King Tang, the founder of the Shang dynasty, and King Wu, the founder of the Zhou dynasty, both heirs to the chaos of the dynasties which preceded them, worked to put the empire into order,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-123a.6" xml:lang="en">causing the people to be unflagging in their efforts,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-123a.7" xml:lang="en">and both of them, by their diligence and circumspection, succeeded in establishing firm rule.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-123a.8" xml:lang="en">And yet little by little the ages after them sank into weakness and decay.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-124a.2" xml:lang="en">Duke Huan of Qi, following the advice of his minister Guan Zhong,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-124a.3" xml:lang="en">initiated the system of buying up goods when the price was low and selling when it was high,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-124a.4" xml:lang="en">and of exploiting the resources of the mountains and seas,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-124a.5" xml:lang="en">until he had the other feudal lords paying court to him and,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-124a.6" xml:lang="en">with what had up until then been the little and out-of-the-way kingdom of Qi, had won for himself the title of dictator.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-124a.7" xml:lang="en">Similarly the king of Wei, by following the theories of Li Ke,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-124a.8" xml:lang="en">was able to secure the maximum yield from his lands</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-124a.9" xml:lang="en">and become a powerful ruler.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-125a.2" xml:lang="en">From the time of these men on,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-125a.3" xml:lang="en">the empire was torn by the strife of the warring kingdoms.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-125a.4" xml:lang="en">Men honored deceit and power and scoffed at benevolence and righteousness;</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-125a.5" xml:lang="en">they put wealth and possession first and courtesy and humility last.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-125a.6" xml:lang="en">Thus it happened that commoners grew so rich that their wealth was counted in the hundreds of millions,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-125a.7" xml:lang="en">while among the poor there were those who could not even get enough dregs and chaff to fill their bellies.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-125a.8" xml:lang="en">The more powerful rulers annexed the smaller fiefs and made subjects of their lords,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-125a.9" xml:lang="en">while in the weaker states the ruling families were wiped out and the sacrifices to their ancestors cut off forever.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-125a.10" xml:lang="en">So it continued until the Qin finally</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-125a.11" xml:lang="en">united all the land within the four seas under a single rule.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-126a.2" xml:lang="en">The currency of the times of Emperor Shun and the Xia dynasty</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-126a.3" xml:lang="en">consisted of three types of metal:</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-126a.4" xml:lang="en">gold,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-126a.5" xml:lang="en">silver,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-126a.6" xml:lang="en">and copper;</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-126a.7" xml:lang="en">while in Zhou times there was copper cash, knife-shaped money,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-126a.8" xml:lang="en">cloth-shaped money,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-126a.10" xml:lang="en">and money made of tortoise shells or sea shells.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-127a.2" xml:lang="en">When the Qin united the world,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-127a.3" xml:lang="en">only two kinds of currency were used throughout the nation.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-127a.4" xml:lang="en">The more valuable was that made of gold in denominations of twenty taels.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-127a.6" xml:lang="en">The less valuable was the copper cash, inscribed with the words "half-tael"</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-127a.7" xml:lang="en">and weighing that amount.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-127a.9" xml:lang="en">(Pearls, jade, tortoise shells, sea shells, silver, tin, and similar materials, though used for utensils or ornaments or stored away as treasures,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-127a.10" xml:lang="en">were not employed as currency.)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-128a.2" xml:lang="en">The currency, however, fluctuated according to the times, having no fixed value.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-128a.3" xml:lang="en">At that time the ruler was busy driving back the barbarians from the borders of the empire,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-128a.4" xml:lang="en">while within the empire he was carrying out various construction works and projects,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-128a.5" xml:lang="en">so that although the men who remained at home worked the fields, they could not supply enough to eat,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-128a.6" xml:lang="en">and though the women wove and spun, they could not produce enough clothing.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-128a.7" xml:lang="en">And so we see that in antiquity there was once a time when the entire wealth and resources of the nation were exhausted in the service of the ruler,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-128a.8" xml:lang="en">and yet he found them insufficient.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-129a.2" xml:lang="en">There was but one reason for this:</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-129a.3" xml:lang="en">the stream of circumstances</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-129a.4" xml:lang="en">flowed so violently at that time that it made such a situation inevitable.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_030-129a.5" xml:lang="en">Surely there is nothing stange about this!22</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-1a.12" xml:lang="en">he announced,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-1a.15" xml:lang="en">The other farm hands laughed and answered,</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.2" xml:lang="en">During the first year of the Second Emperor of Qin (209 BC),154 in the seventh month,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.3" xml:lang="en">an order came for a force of 900 men from the poor side of the town</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.4" xml:lang="en">to be sent to garrison Yuyang.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.5" xml:lang="en">Chen She and Wu Guang were among those whose turn it was to go,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.6" xml:lang="en">and they were appointed heads of the levy men.155</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.7" xml:lang="en">When the group had gone as far as Daze County, they encountered such heavy rain</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.8" xml:lang="en">that the road became impassable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.9" xml:lang="en">It was apparent that the men would be unable to reach the appointed place on time,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.10" xml:lang="en">an offence punishable by death.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.12" xml:lang="en">"As things stand, we face death whether we stay or run away," they said,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.13" xml:lang="en">"while if we were to start a revolt we would likewise face death.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.14" xml:lang="en">Since we must die in any case,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.15" xml:lang="en">would it not be better to die fighting for our country?"156</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.16" xml:lang="en">"The world has long suffered under Qin," said Chen She.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.17" xml:lang="en">From what I have heard, the Second Emperor was a younger son</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.18" xml:lang="en">and ought never to have succeeded to the throne.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.19" xml:lang="en">The one who should have been made ruler was Prince Fusu.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.20" xml:lang="en">But because Fusu several times remonstrated with the former emperor,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.21" xml:lang="en">he was sent to lead the armies in the fields.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.22" xml:lang="en">Someone has told me that, though Fusu was guilty of no crime,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.23" xml:lang="en">he has been murdered by the Second Emperor.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.24" xml:lang="en">The common people have heard much of Fusu's worth,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.25" xml:lang="en">but they do not know that he is dead.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.26" xml:lang="en">Xiang Yan was a general of Chu</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.27" xml:lang="en">who several time distinguished himself in battle.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.28" xml:lang="en">he took good care of his troops</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.29" xml:lang="en">and the people of Chu thought fondly of him.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.30" xml:lang="en">Some say that he is dead,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.31" xml:lang="en">but others say that he is only in hiding.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.32" xml:lang="en">Now with the group we have, if we could deceive people into thinking</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.33" xml:lang="en">that I am Fusu and you are Xiang Yan,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.34" xml:lang="en">we could lead the world in our own tune,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.35" xml:lang="en">and there are sure to be many who will join in the chorus!"</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.36" xml:lang="en">Wu Guang approved of this idea,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.37" xml:lang="en">and they went to consult a diviner.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.38" xml:lang="en">The diviner guessed what the two were planning,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.39" xml:lang="en">and replied,</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.40" xml:lang="en">"Your undertakings will all meet with success.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.41" xml:lang="en">But might you not seek your fortune with the spirits?"157</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.42" xml:lang="en">Chen She and Wu Guang were delighted with the idea</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.43" xml:lang="en">of enlisting supernatural aide in their scheme.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.45" xml:lang="en">"It must mean that we should first do something to overawe</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.46" xml:lang="en">the men in our group!" they declared,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.47" xml:lang="en">and proceeded to write with cinnabar on a piece of silk:</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.48" xml:lang="en">"Chen She shall be a king."</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.49" xml:lang="en">They stuffed the silk into the belly of a fish someone had caught in a net.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.50" xml:lang="en">When one of the soldiers bought the fish and boiled it for his dinner,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.51" xml:lang="en">he discovered the message in the fish's belly</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.52" xml:lang="en">and was greatly astonished.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.53" xml:lang="en">Also Chen She secretly sent Wu Guang</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.54" xml:lang="en">to a grove of trees surrounding a shrine which was close to where the men were making camp.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.55" xml:lang="en">When the night fell, Wu Guang lit a torch and, partly concealing it under a basket,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.56" xml:lang="en">began to wail like a fox and cry,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.57" xml:lang="en">"Great Chu shall rise again!</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.58" xml:lang="en">Chen She shall be king!"</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.59" xml:lang="en">The soldiers were filled with alarm,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.60" xml:lang="en">and when dawn came</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.61" xml:lang="en">they talked here and there among themselves,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-2a.62" xml:lang="en">pointing and staring at Chen She.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-3a.2" xml:lang="en">Wu Guang had always been kind to others</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-3a.3" xml:lang="en">and many of the sodiers would do anything for him.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-3a.4" xml:lang="en">When the officer in command of the troop was drunk,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-3a.5" xml:lang="en">Wu Guang made a point of openly announcing several times</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-3a.6" xml:lang="en">that he was going to run away.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-3a.7" xml:lang="en">In this way Wu Guang hoped to arouse the commander's anger,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-3a.8" xml:lang="en">get him to punish him,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-3a.9" xml:lang="en">and so stir up the men's ire and resentment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-3a.10" xml:lang="en">As Wu Guang had expected, the commander began to beat him,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-3a.11" xml:lang="en">when the commander's sword slipped out of its scabbard.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-3a.12" xml:lang="en">Wu Guang sprang up,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-3a.13" xml:lang="en">seized the sword, and killed the commander,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-3a.14" xml:lang="en">Chen She rushed to his assistance,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-3a.15" xml:lang="en">and they proceeded to kill the other two commanding officers as well.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-3a.16" xml:lang="en">Then they called together all the men of the group and announced:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-3a.17" xml:lang="en">"Because of the rain we encountered,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-3a.18" xml:lang="en">we cannot reach our rendezvous on time.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-3a.19" xml:lang="en">And anyone who misses a rendezvous has his head cut off!</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-3a.20" xml:lang="en">Even if you somehow should escape with your heads,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-3a.21" xml:lang="en">six or seven out of ten of you are bound to die in the course of garrison duty.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-3a.22" xml:lang="en">Now, my brave fellows, if you are unwilling to die, we have nothing more to say.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-3a.23" xml:lang="en">But if you would risk death, then let us risk it for the sake of fame and glory!</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-3a.24" xml:lang="en">Kings and nobles, general and ministers - such men are made, not born!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-3a.25" xml:lang="en">The men of the garrison all replied,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-3a.26" xml:lang="en">"We勁l do whatever you say!"</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-3a.27" xml:lang="en">Then, in order to win the loyalty of the people,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-3a.28" xml:lang="en">Chen She and Wu Guang falsely proclaimed themselves to be Prince Fusu and Xiang Yan.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-3a.29" xml:lang="en">Baring their right shoulders,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-3a.30" xml:lang="en">they raised the cry of "Great Chu!"</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-3a.31" xml:lang="en">and built an altar and swore an oath before it,</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-3a.33" xml:lang="en">Chen She set himself up as commander of the army,</seg>

<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_048-25a.30" xml:lang="en">After this he ascended and fortified Mt. Hua,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_072-8a.19" xml:lang="en">constitutes a deadly enemy to Qin.14</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_072-8a.26" xml:lang="en">and Qin are bitter enemies,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_072-8a.27" xml:lang="en">that would not be to the profit of Qin.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_072-8a.28" xml:lang="en">This is the first reason.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_072-8a.29" xml:lang="en">"Qin's strategists</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_072-8a.30" xml:lang="en">are no doubt assuming that in defeating Qi,</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_072-8a.33" xml:lang="en">But Qi</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_072-8a.34" xml:lang="en">is a state whose power is exhausted.</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_072-8a.36" xml:lang="en">is like using a thousand-pound crossbow to puncture a suppurating boil.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_072-8a.37" xml:lang="en">Of course Qi is doomed,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_072-8a.38" xml:lang="en">but how will that wear out Jin and Chu?</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_072-8a.39" xml:lang="en">This is the second reason.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_072-8a.40" xml:lang="en">"If Qin contributes only a few troops to the undertaking,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_072-8a.42" xml:lang="en">And if it contributes a large number of troops,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_072-8a.43" xml:lang="en">then Jin and Chu will be overshadowed by Qin.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_072-8a.44" xml:lang="en">In that case Qi in its alarm</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_072-8a.45" xml:lang="en">will not look to Qin for mercy</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_072-8a.46" xml:lang="en">but will invariably turn to Jin and Chu.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_072-8a.47" xml:lang="en">This is the third reason.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_072-8a.48" xml:lang="en">"If Qin carves up Qi and feeds the pieces to Jin and Chu,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_072-8a.49" xml:lang="en">and Jin and Chu have to station troops to secure the areas,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_072-8a.50" xml:lang="en">then Qin will appear to be an enemy rather than an ally.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_072-8a.51" xml:lang="en">This is the fourth reason.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_072-8a.52" xml:lang="en">And in the end it will seem as though Jin and Chu have been using Qin to undo Qi,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_072-8a.53" xml:lang="en">and using Qi to undo Qin,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_072-8a.54" xml:lang="en">and people will think, how wise of Jin and Chu, and how stupit of Qin and Qi!</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_072-8a.55" xml:lang="en">This is the fifth reason.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_072-8a.56" xml:lang="en">"Therefore if Qin should acquire Anyi and treat it well,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_072-8a.57" xml:lang="en">then it would surely have nothing to worry about.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_072-8a.58" xml:lang="en">And if Qin acquires Anyi,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_072-8a.60" xml:lang="en">Which would be more profitable, to seize on the very vitals of the empire,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_072-8a.61" xml:lang="en">or to sent out troops and fear they may never return again?</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_072-8a.62" xml:lang="en">That is why I said to my ruler, 'The king of Qin is intelligent and astute in planning,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-11a.17" xml:lang="en">and the emperor saw him off as far as the Ba River.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-11a.18" xml:lang="en">As they were going on their way,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-11a.19" xml:lang="en">Wang Jian requested the emperor for the gift of a great many fine fields and houses, gardens and ponds.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-11a.20" xml:lang="en">The emperor said,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-11a.21" xml:lang="en">"Just go on your way, General.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-11a.22" xml:lang="en">Why all this worry over poverty?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-11a.23" xml:lang="en">Wang Jian replied,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-11a.24" xml:lang="en">"Though many of Your Majesty's generals have achieved merit,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-11a.25" xml:lang="en">they have never succeeded in being enfeoffed as marquises.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-11a.26" xml:lang="en">So while I enjoy Your Majesty's favour,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-11a.27" xml:lang="en">I want to use the opportunity to ask for fields and ponds for the sake of my sons and grandsons, that is all."</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-11a.28" xml:lang="en">The emperor roared with laughter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-11a.29" xml:lang="en">By the time Wang Jian reached the Hangu Pass,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-11a.30" xml:lang="en">he had five times sent messengers back to the capital to repeat his request for suitable farm lands.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-11a.31" xml:lang="en">Someone said to him,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-11a.32" xml:lang="en">"Aren't you being a bit too persistent</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-11a.33" xml:lang="en">in the way you beg for rewards, General?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-11a.34" xml:lang="en">"Not at all,"</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-11a.35" xml:lang="en">replied Wang Jian.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-11a.36" xml:lang="en">The King of Qin is suspicious and puts no trust in others.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-11a.37" xml:lang="en">Now he has emptied the state of Qin of all its armed men and turned them over to my sole authority.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-11a.38" xml:lang="en">If I do not ask for a lot of fields and houses for the sake of my sons and grandsons and seem to be thinking only of my own interests,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-11a.39" xml:lang="en">then I will just give him occasion to doubt my motives."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-12a.2" xml:lang="en">Thus Wang Jian in the end replaced Li Xin as leader of the attack on Jing.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-12a.3" xml:lang="en">When the king of Jing heard that Wang Jian was on his way with a greatly augmented army,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-12a.4" xml:lang="en">he called out all the soldiers in the country to repel the Qin forces.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-12a.5" xml:lang="en">Arriving in Jing,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-12a.6" xml:lang="en">Wang Jian proceeded to build strong fortifications and stay within them,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-12a.7" xml:lang="en">unwilling to engage in battle.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-12a.8" xml:lang="en">The Jing soldiers repeatedly challenged him to cambat,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-12a.9" xml:lang="en">but he would never emerge from his defences.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-12a.10" xml:lang="en">Each day Wang Jian rested his soldiers, allowing them to bathe and wash their hair,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-12a.11" xml:lang="en">and kept them content with good food and drink.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-12a.12" xml:lang="en">He mingled with his men and ate the same food they did.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-12a.13" xml:lang="en">After some time,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-12a.14" xml:lang="en">he sent someone to ask what amusements they indulged in.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-12a.15" xml:lang="en">"Stone-throwing and high-jumping?"</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-12a.16" xml:lang="en">was the answer.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-12a.17" xml:lang="en">With that Wang Jian said,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-12a.18" xml:lang="en">"The men are now in shape for use."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-12a.19" xml:lang="en">Though Jing had repeatly challenged the Qin troops to battle, they refused to come forth,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-12a.20" xml:lang="en">and so the Jing troops began to withdraw and go back east.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-12a.21" xml:lang="en">Wang Jian then called out all his men and went in pursuit,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-12a.22" xml:lang="en">ordering the young men to lead the attack,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-12a.23" xml:lang="en">and dealt a crushing blow to the Jing army.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-12a.24" xml:lang="en">Advancing as far as the area south of the Qi River,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-12a.25" xml:lang="en">he killed the Jing general Xiang Yan,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-12a.26" xml:lang="en">and with this the Jing forces fled in defeat.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-12a.27" xml:lang="en">Taking full advantage of the victory, the Qin army seized control of one after another of Jing's cities and towns,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-12a.28" xml:lang="en">and a year or so later</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-12a.29" xml:lang="en">captured the Jing king Fuchu.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-12a.30" xml:lang="en">Thus Wang Jian put down all resistance in the region of Jing, which was made into provinces and districts,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-12a.31" xml:lang="en">and then proceeded south to subjugate the rulers of the Hundred Yue tribes.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-12a.32" xml:lang="en">Meanwhile Wang Jian's son Wang Ben</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-12a.33" xml:lang="en">joined with Li Xin in defeating and gaining control of the state of Yan and Qi.</seg>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_073-14a.8" xml:lang="en">Someone said,</seg>

</p>
<p>

<p>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_079-7a.11" xml:lang="en">Later, when the marquis of Rang becamemilitary leader of Qin,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_079-7a.12" xml:lang="en">He hoped to cross the states of Hann and Wei</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_079-7a.15" xml:lang="en">At this point Fan Ju submitted a letter to the king which said:</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_084-19a.11" xml:lang="en">When Emperor Wen first came to the throne</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_084-19a.13" xml:lang="en">was one of the most skilled administrators in the empire and,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_084-19a.14" xml:lang="en">being from the same city as the famous Qin minister Li Si,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_084-19a.19" xml:lang="en">Emperor Wen accordingly summoned Jia Yi and made him an erudite.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_084-20a.2" xml:lang="en">Jia Yi, only a little over twenty years old,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_084-20a.3" xml:lang="en">was the youngest among the court scholars,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_084-20a.7" xml:lang="en">expressing what each of the others would like to have said but could not put into words.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_084-20a.8" xml:lang="en">The other scholars soon came to feel</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_084-20a.10" xml:lang="en">Emperor Wen was highly pleased with Jia Yi</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_084-20a.11" xml:lang="en">and advanced him with unusual rapidity,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_084-20a.12" xml:lang="en">so that in the space of a year Jia Yi reached the position of palace counsellor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_084-21a.2" xml:lang="en">Jia Yi believed that, since by the reign of Emperor Wen the Han</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_084-21a.4" xml:lang="en">and the empire was at peace,</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_084-21a.10" xml:lang="en">He therefore drew up a draft of his proposals</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_084-21a.16" xml:lang="en">But Emperor Wen had just come to the throne</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_084-21a.17" xml:lang="en">and he modestly declined any ability or leisure to put into effect such far-reaching measures.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_084-21a.18" xml:lang="en">He did, however, direct revisions in the pitch pipes and in the statutes</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_084-21a.19" xml:lang="en">and order the marquises to leave the capital and reside in their own territories,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_084-21a.21" xml:lang="en">Emperor Wen then (p.445) consulted with his minsters,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_084-21a.22" xml:lang="en">asking whether they did not think that Jia Yi was worthy</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_084-21a.23" xml:lang="en">of promotion to a top position in the government.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_084-21a.24" xml:lang="en">Zhou Bo, Guan Ying, Zhang Xiangru,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_084-21a.25" xml:lang="en">Feng Jing, and the rest of their group, however, all opposed such a move</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_084-21a.26" xml:lang="en">and disparaged Jia Yi, saying,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_084-21a.31" xml:lang="en">After this the emperor grew cool toward Jia Yi</seg>

</p>
<p>

<p>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-3a.25" xml:lang="en">and since she has no sons of her own,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-3a.26" xml:lang="en">it will be up to her alone to decide which son should be appointed as the rightful heir.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-3a.29" xml:lang="en">You enjoy no particular favour and</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-3a.30" xml:lang="en">have been a hostage at the court of one of the other feudal lords for a long time.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-3a.31" xml:lang="en">If your grandfather, the old king, should pass away</seg>

</p>
<p>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-3a.38" xml:lang="en">Ly Buwei said,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-3a.39" xml:lang="en">"You are poor</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-3a.40" xml:lang="en">and living in a foreign land.</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-3a.42" xml:lang="en">or to attract a band of followers about you.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-3a.43" xml:lang="en">I too am poor,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-3a.44" xml:lang="en">but with your permission I would like to take a thousand measures of gold</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-3a.45" xml:lang="en">and travel west on your behalf to Qin,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-3a.46" xml:lang="en">where I will wait upon Lord Anguo and Lady Huayang</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-3a.47" xml:lang="en">and see to it that you are made the rightful heir."</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-3a.48" xml:lang="en">Zichu bowed his head and said,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-3a.49" xml:lang="en">"If indeed it should turn out as you say,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-3a.50" xml:lang="en">when the day comes I hope you will allow me to divide the state of Qin</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-3a.51" xml:lang="en">and share it with you!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.2" xml:lang="en">Ly Buwei accordingly took 500 measures of gold</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.3" xml:lang="en">and presented it to Zichu</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.4" xml:lang="en">to be used as expense money</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.5" xml:lang="en">in attracting a band of followers,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.6" xml:lang="en">and with another 500 he purchased various rare objects,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.8" xml:lang="en">which he took with him west on a trip to Qin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.9" xml:lang="en">There he sought an interview with the elder sister of Lady Huayang</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.10" xml:lang="en">and asked that the gifts he had brought be presented to Lady Huayang.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.11" xml:lang="en">He took the opportunity to mention how virtuous and wise Zichu was,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.13" xml:lang="en">all over the world,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.14" xml:lang="en">how he was constantly heard to exclaim,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.16" xml:lang="en">and how he wept day and night with longing for his</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.18" xml:lang="en">Lady Huayang was very pleased with this message.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.19" xml:lang="en">Ly Buwei then persuaded the elder sister to speak to Lady Huayang to this effect:</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.20" xml:lang="en">"They say that</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.21" xml:lang="en">one who had only beauty to offer a man will find,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.22" xml:lang="en">as beauty fades, that his love grows cold.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.23" xml:lang="en">Now you wait upon the crown prince but,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.24" xml:lang="en">though he loves you dearly, you have no son.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.25" xml:lang="en">Before it is too late, should you not take this opportunity to choose one of his sons whom you deem worthy and befriend him,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.26" xml:lang="en">seeing to it that he is elevated to the position of rightful heir</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.27" xml:lang="en">and treating him as your own son?</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.28" xml:lang="en">Then, as long as your husband lives, you will enjoy honour;</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.29" xml:lang="en">andwhen his hundred years of life are ended</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.30" xml:lang="en">and the one whom you call son becomes king,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.31" xml:lang="en">you need never fear any loss of position.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.32" xml:lang="en">This is what they call</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.33" xml:lang="en">'speaking one word that brings ten thousand years of gain.'</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.34" xml:lang="en">But if now in blossom time you do not make certain that your roots are firm,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.35" xml:lang="en">then when beauty has faded and love grown cold,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.36" xml:lang="en">so you hope for a chance to 'speak one word',</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.37" xml:lang="en">how could you gain a hearing?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.38" xml:lang="en">Now Zichu is a worthy man and,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.39" xml:lang="en">being far down the line, knows that</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.40" xml:lang="en">he cannot hope to become heir by the normal order of succession.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.41" xml:lang="en">In addition, his mother enjoys no favour,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.42" xml:lang="en">and so he offers all his devotion to you.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.43" xml:lang="en">If you were truly willingly to use this moment</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.44" xml:lang="en">to pluck him from the line of succession and make him theheir,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.45" xml:lang="en">then to the end of your days</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.46" xml:lang="en">you would enjoy favour in the state of Qin!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.47" xml:lang="en">Lady Huayang, convinced of the truth of this argument,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.48" xml:lang="en">waited until her husband, the crown prince, was at leisure and</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.49" xml:lang="en">then casually mentioned that Zichu, who had been sent as a hostage to Zhao,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.50" xml:lang="en">was a man of outstanding worth</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.51" xml:lang="en">and that everyone coming from abroad praised him highly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.52" xml:lang="en">Then, with tears in her eyes, she said,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.53" xml:lang="en">"I have been fortunate enough to be assigned to your women's quarters,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.57" xml:lang="en">Lord Anguo gave his consent</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.58" xml:lang="en">and had a jade tally engraved to this effect which he divided with Lady Huayang,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.59" xml:lang="en">promising that he would make Zichu his rightful heir.280</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.60" xml:lang="en">Then Lord Anguo and Lady Huayang sent rich gifts to Zichu</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.61" xml:lang="en">and asked Lyu Buwei to act as his tutor.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.62" xml:lang="en">As a result, Zichu became increasingly renowned</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-4a.63" xml:lang="en">among the feudal lords.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-5a.2" xml:lang="en">Ly Buwei had selected from the ladies of Handan</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-5a.4" xml:lang="en">and in time he learned that she was pregnant.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-5a.5" xml:lang="en">Zichu, joining Ly Buwei in a drinking bout,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-5a.6" xml:lang="en">happened to catch sight of her and was pleased.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-5a.7" xml:lang="en">Immediately he stood up, proposed a toast (p.162) to Ly`s long life,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-5a.8" xml:lang="en">and asked if he might have her.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-5a.9" xml:lang="en">Ly Buwei was outraged,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-5a.10" xml:lang="en">but soon recalled that he had by now invested all his family哀 wealth in Zichu</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-5a.11" xml:lang="en">in hopes of fishing up some wonderful prize,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-5a.12" xml:lang="en">and so in the end he presented the woman to him.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-5a.13" xml:lang="en">She concealed the fact that she was pregnant,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-5a.16" xml:lang="en">Zichu eventually made her his consort.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-6a.2" xml:lang="en">In the fiftieth year of his reign (257 BC)</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_085-6a.3" xml:lang="en">King Zhaoxiang of Qin sent Wang Yi to lay siege to Handan and,</seg>

</p>
<p>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-1a.3" xml:lang="en">a man from the state of Lu,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-1a.4" xml:lang="en">was of great courage and physical strength,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-1a.5" xml:lang="en">and thus came into the service of the ruler, Duke Solemn (693-662),</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-1a.6" xml:lang="en">who admired such qualities.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-1a.7" xml:lang="en">He was put in command of Luyu armed forces</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-1a.8" xml:lang="en">and in battles with the Kingdom of Qi</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-1a.9" xml:lang="en">was thrice defeated and put to flight.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-1a.10" xml:lang="en">Alarmed by this,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-1a.11" xml:lang="en">Duke Solemn sought to obtain peace at the cost of ceding the demesne of Fulfilment to Qi.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-1a.12" xml:lang="en">Nevertheless he still retained Cao Mo as commander of his forces.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-2a.2" xml:lang="en">Duke Mighty order of Qi (6í-642) agreed to meet the ruler of Lu</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-2a.3" xml:lang="en">at Axehandle to make a treaty.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-2a.4" xml:lang="en">After they had both solemnised their pact on a raised ritual terrace,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-2a.5" xml:lang="en">Cao Mo with a dirk in his hand suddenly menaced the Duke of Qi.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-2a.6" xml:lang="en">Since none of his close attendants dared so much as to make a move,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-2a.7" xml:lang="en">the Duke tried questioning his assailant.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-2a.8" xml:lang="en">"What might it be you require from me?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-2a.9" xml:lang="en">"Admittedly Qi is strong, and Lu is weak," replied Cao Mo,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-2a.10" xml:lang="en">"But your great nation has gone too far in its violation of our country.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-2a.11" xml:lang="en">If you destroy the defense walls of Lu,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-2a.12" xml:lang="en">then a buffer against your greater enemies will have been removed and the pressure will be on your own frontier.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-2a.13" xml:lang="en">You might just think that over, my lord."</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-2a.14" xml:lang="en">Duke Mighty Order promptly agreed to return to Lu</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-2a.15" xml:lang="en">all the territory which he had previously conquered.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-2a.16" xml:lang="en">Once the Duke had given his word,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-2a.17" xml:lang="en">Cao Mo immediately threw away his dirk,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-2a.18" xml:lang="en">descended from the terrace,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-2a.19" xml:lang="en">paid his loyal respects, and went to his place among the other officials,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-2a.20" xml:lang="en">showing no change in facial expression</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-2a.21" xml:lang="en">and engaging in casual conversation as before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-2a.22" xml:lang="en">Duke Mighty Order was enraged</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-2a.23" xml:lang="en">and had every intention of breaking the agreement.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-2a.24" xml:lang="en">"No, that won't do," said his great minister Guan Zhong.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-2a.25" xml:lang="en">"To display such niggardly covetousness and personal indulgence</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-2a.26" xml:lang="en">is to throw away the confidence of the rulers of the other states</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-2a.27" xml:lang="en">and loose us support throughout the world.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-2a.28" xml:lang="en">You're best advised to return them their territory."</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-2a.29" xml:lang="en">Heeding this advice, Duke Mighty Order</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-2a.30" xml:lang="en">ceded Lu its conquered (p.132) lands,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-2a.31" xml:lang="en">and the area which Cao Mo had lost in his three battles</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-2a.32" xml:lang="en">was all restored to Lu.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-3a.2" xml:lang="en">One hundred and sixty-seven years afterwards</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-3a.3" xml:lang="en">there occurred the affair of Zhuan Zhu in the Kingdom of Wu.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-4a.2" xml:lang="en">Zhuan Zhu</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-4a.3" xml:lang="en">was a native of Hall Land county in Wu.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-4a.4" xml:lang="en">When Wu Zixu fled from Wu to Chu,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-4a.5" xml:lang="en">he got to know of Zhuan Zhu's great ability.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-4a.6" xml:lang="en">After gaining an audience with King Handsome of Wu (526-515),</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-4a.7" xml:lang="en">Wu Zixu tried to persuade the King of the advantages of attacking the Kingdom of Chu.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-4a.8" xml:lang="en">"This fellow Wu Zixu," cautioned Prince Light,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-4a.9" xml:lang="en">"had a father and brother who both met their deaths at the hands of the King of Chu</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-4a.10" xml:lang="en">His suggestion that we should launch a campaign against Chu</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-4a.11" xml:lang="en">is designed to accomplish his own personal vendetta</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-4a.12" xml:lang="en">and cannot possibly be intended for our advantage."</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-4a.13" xml:lang="en">The King of Wu went no further with the matter.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-4a.14" xml:lang="en">Wu Zixu learned that Prince Light had long nursed the secret desire</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-4a.15" xml:lang="en">to do away with King Handsome.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-4a.16" xml:lang="en">"Prince Light must have his eyes on the throne," concluded Wu Zixu.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-4a.17" xml:lang="en">"The time is not yet ripe for me to try to influence foreign policy."</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-4a.18" xml:lang="en">With this in mind he recommended Zhuan Zhu into the Prince's service.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-5a.2" xml:lang="en">Prince Light's father was the former King of Wu, Zhufan (560-548),</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-5a.3" xml:lang="en">who had three younger brothers,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-5a.4" xml:lang="en">the first called Yuzhai,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-5a.5" xml:lang="en">the second Yimo,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-5a.6" xml:lang="en">and the youngest Youngest Son Zha.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-5a.7" xml:lang="en">King Zhufan realized that Youngest Son Zha was a man of great ability,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-5a.8" xml:lang="en">so he did not set up his Crown Prince as successor,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-5a.9" xml:lang="en">but instead decreed that the succession should pass to each of the brothers in turn,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-5a.10" xml:lang="en">calculating that Youngest Son Zha would thus eventually succeed to the throne anyway.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-5a.11" xml:lang="en">On the death of Zhufan</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-5a.12" xml:lang="en">the throne passed to Yuzhai (547-531).</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-5a.13" xml:lang="en">After him</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-5a.14" xml:lang="en">it passed to Yimo (530-527):</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-5a.15" xml:lang="en">And then</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-5a.16" xml:lang="en">it should have been Youngest Son Zha's turn.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-5a.17" xml:lang="en">But he was of another mind and fled the country to avoid assuming his responsibilities,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-5a.18" xml:lang="en">so the people of Wu set up Yimo's son Handsome instead.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-5a.20" xml:lang="en">"Supposing the succession went by order of brothers,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-5a.21" xml:lang="en">then Youngest Son Zha should be King," was Prince Light's reaction.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-5a.22" xml:lang="en">"But if we were to resort to succession by sons,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-5a.23" xml:lang="en">then I am the legitimate heir</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-5a.24" xml:lang="en">and should be King."</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-5a.25" xml:lang="en">Thinking in this way, he made it his business secretly to take under his wing gentleman of keen intellect and cunning enterprise to further his ambitions for the crown. [!?]</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-6a.2" xml:lang="en">When he aquired the services of Zhuan Zhu,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-6a.3" xml:lang="en">he accorded him excellent treatment as one of his own retainers.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-6a.4" xml:lang="en">Nine years later King Pacifier of Chu (528-516) died.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-6a.5" xml:lang="en">In the following spring</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-6a.6" xml:lang="en">King Handsome, wishing to take advantage of the death of the Chu monarch,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-6a.7" xml:lang="en">sent his two younger brothers the Princes Gaiyu and Zhuyang</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-6a.8" xml:lang="en">at the heads of troops to lay siege to the city of Qian in Chu,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-6a.9" xml:lang="en">and also sent Youngest Son Zha, now Lord of Long Tombs,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-6a.10" xml:lang="en">to the neutral state of Jin,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-6a.11" xml:lang="en">where he was to observe in diplomatic circles the other ruler's</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-6a.12" xml:lang="en">reactions to these developments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-6a.13" xml:lang="en">Chu sent troops to cut off Gaiyu's and Zhuyong's lines of retreat,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-6a.14" xml:lang="en">preventing the armies of Wu from returning.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-6a.15" xml:lang="en">"This is too good a opportunity to miss,"</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-6a.16" xml:lang="en">said Prince Light to Zhuan Zhu on hearing this news.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-6a.17" xml:lang="en">"Nothing ventured, nothing gained.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-6a.18" xml:lang="en">Besides I am the true heir apparent</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-6a.19" xml:lang="en">and ought to be King.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-6a.20" xml:lang="en">Even if Youngest Son Zha returns,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-6a.21" xml:lang="en">he won't depose me."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-6a.22" xml:lang="en">"I would say," suggested Zhuan Zhu,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-6a.23" xml:lang="en">"that it would be quite a viable proposition to kill the King.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-6a.24" xml:lang="en">His mother is old and his children mere infants.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-6a.25" xml:lang="en">His two younger brothers are trapped</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-6a.26" xml:lang="en">with their armies in Chu,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-6a.27" xml:lang="en">At this juncture the King of Wu,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-6a.28" xml:lang="en">having embroiled himself in serious trouble abroad in Chu</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-6a.29" xml:lang="en">and being left with no faithful champions here at home,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-6a.30" xml:lang="en">just couldn咨 touch us."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-6a.31" xml:lang="en">said Prince Light, kowtowing his thanks to Zhuan Zhu for this advice.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-6a.32" xml:lang="en">"I value your life</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-6a.33" xml:lang="en">as I do my own,"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-7a.2" xml:lang="en">One day (between 7 March and 5 April 515 B.C.]</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-7a.3" xml:lang="en">Prince Light had mailed knights concealed in one of his cellars</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-7a.4" xml:lang="en">and held a wine feast to which he had invited King Handsome.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-7a.5" xml:lang="en">The King providentially positioned his troops along the road</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-7a.6" xml:lang="en">from his palace to Prince Light's residence,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-7a.7" xml:lang="en">where his own clansmen were stationed by the steps and doorways.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-7a.8" xml:lang="en">They lined his route</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-7a.9" xml:lang="en">with long two-edged swords in their hands.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-7a.10" xml:lang="en">At the height of their feasting,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-7a.11" xml:lang="en">Prince Light feigned a twinge of gout and excused himself from the company.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-7a.12" xml:lang="en">Then he went down to the cellar</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-7a.13" xml:lang="en">where he instructed Zhuan Zhu to conceal a dirk inside a grilled fish</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-7a.14" xml:lang="en">and serve the fish to the King.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-7a.15" xml:lang="en">Once he was in front of the King,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-7a.16" xml:lang="en">Zhuan Zhu split open the fish,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-7a.17" xml:lang="en">snatched up the dirk, and stabbed the King</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-7a.18" xml:lang="en">to death on the spot.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-7a.19" xml:lang="en">Those in close attendance upon the King then slew Zhuan Zhu,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-7a.20" xml:lang="en">after which the King's men fell into confusion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-7a.21" xml:lang="en">It was at this point that Prince Light chose to spring his ambush</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-7a.22" xml:lang="en">and set his armoured knights upon the King's followers</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-7a.23" xml:lang="en">who were slain to a man.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-7a.24" xml:lang="en">So it was that Prince Light made himself monarch,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-7a.25" xml:lang="en">the King whom we know as Helyu (514-496).</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-7a.26" xml:lang="en">He enfoeffed Zhuan Zhu's son</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-7a.27" xml:lang="en">and made him his Prime Minister.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-8a.2" xml:lang="en">What follows now took place some seventy years later</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-8a.3" xml:lang="en">and concerns a man called Yu Rang,</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-9a.3" xml:lang="en">a native of the State of Jin.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-9a.4" xml:lang="en">He had served two of the six feudal clans, Clan Fan</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-9a.5" xml:lang="en">and Clan Zhongxing;</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-9a.6" xml:lang="en">but his service with them did nothing to advance his reputation,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-9a.7" xml:lang="en">so he left them and took up employment with the Earl of Zhi, chief of Clan Zhi,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-9a.8" xml:lang="en">who treated him with great honour and favour.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-9a.9" xml:lang="en">When the Earl of Zhi attacked Viscount Accomplishment of Zhao, head of Clan Zhao,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-9a.10" xml:lang="en">the latter joined with the clans of Han and Wei</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-9a.11" xml:lang="en">to plot the Earl's annihilation.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-9a.12" xml:lang="en">This fulfilled,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-9a.13" xml:lang="en">they devided up his territory between the three of them.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-9a.14" xml:lang="en">It was Viscount Accomplishment of Zhao who hated the Earl most of all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-9a.15" xml:lang="en">Such was his lingering animosity that he had his skull lacquered</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-9a.16" xml:lang="en">and made into a drinking vessel.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-9a.17" xml:lang="en">"Bitter fate," cried Yu Rang,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-9a.18" xml:lang="en">who had escaped and fled into the mountains.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-9a.19" xml:lang="en">"'A gentleman will lay down his life for a true friend as gladly</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-9a.20" xml:lang="en">as a lady preparing her body for her true love.'</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-9a.25" xml:lang="en">He changed his name and assumed the identity of a convict labourer.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-9a.26" xml:lang="en">Eventually he managed to find employment in the palace, white-washing the privy.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-9a.27" xml:lang="en">On his person he had concealed a dagger</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_086-9a.28" xml:lang="en">with the intention of stabbing Viscount Accomplishment.</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_089-4a.9" xml:lang="en">it is imperative that you become a king.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_089-4a.10" xml:lang="en">We beg you to declare youself king of Chu!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_089-4a.11" xml:lang="en">Chen She questioned Zhang Er and Chen Yu about this,</seg>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

<p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_101-1a.10" xml:lang="en">he was made a palace attendant.</seg>

<p>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_101-2a.7" xml:lang="en">One day Yuan Ang stepped forward from his place and asked,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_101-2a.9" xml:lang="en">"He is a veritable guardian of the altars of the nation," replied the emperor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_101-2a.10" xml:lang="en">"Zhou Bo may indeed be termed a worthy minister," said Yuan Ang,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_101-2a.12" xml:lang="en">A true guardian of the nation will serve his lord while his lord lives,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_101-2a.14" xml:lang="en">In the time of Empress Ly</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_101-2a.15" xml:lang="en">the members of the Ly family wielded power in the government</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_101-2a.16" xml:lang="en">and arbitrarily made themselves kings and ministers,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_101-2a.17" xml:lang="en">so that the life of the Liu dynasty hung by a thread.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_101-2a.18" xml:lang="en">At that time Zhou Bo was grand commandant</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_101-2a.19" xml:lang="en">and was in charge of the military,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_101-2a.20" xml:lang="en">and yet he was not able to remedy the situation.</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_101-2a.27" xml:lang="en">He appears before the ruler with an arrogant air,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_101-2a.31" xml:lang="en">After this the emperor behaved with greater austerty in court,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_101-2a.32" xml:lang="en">and Zhou Bo approached him with increasing awe.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_101-2a.33" xml:lang="en">Form this time on Zhou Bo came to hate Yuan Ang.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_101-3a.2" xml:lang="en">Afte Zhou Bo retired from the position of chancellor</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_101-3a.4" xml:lang="en">one of the natives of the place sent a report to the throne</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_101-3a.9" xml:lang="en">Only Yuan Ang pleaded for him and proved that he was not guilty.</seg>

</p>
<p>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_101-6a.24" xml:lang="en">Weeping bitterly, Zhao Tan descended.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_101-7a.2" xml:lang="en">Another time Emperor Wen had ridden in his carriage to the top of the hill at Baling</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_101-7a.19" xml:lang="en">The emperor gave up the idea.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_101-8a.2" xml:lang="en">Emperor Wen was one time paying a visit to the Shanglin Park,</seg>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

<p>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-10a.20" xml:lang="en">Another time Tian Fen asked the emperor for the land used by the government artisans so that he could increase the grounds of his estate,</seg>

<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-11a.2" xml:lang="en">Dou Ying for his part had grown more and more estranged from the emperor since the death of Empress Dowager Dou.</seg>

<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-17a.26" xml:lang="en">Guan Fu then rode off in his carriage</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-17a.28" xml:lang="en">As it turned out, however, Tian Fen had only been joking the day before when he consented to the visit</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-17a.29" xml:lang="en">and had not the slightest intention of going.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-17a.30" xml:lang="en">When Guan Fu reached Tian Fen's house,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-17a.31" xml:lang="en">he found that the chancellor was still in bed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-17a.32" xml:lang="en">He marched straight into the room and confronted Tian Fen.</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-17a.36" xml:lang="en">They have been waiting from dawn until now</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-17a.37" xml:lang="en">without daring to take a bite to eat!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-17a.38" xml:lang="en">Tian Fen was very startled and began to apologize, saying,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-17a.39" xml:lang="en">"I as a little drunk yesterday</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-17a.40" xml:lang="en">and I completely forgot about our conversation,"</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-17a.43" xml:lang="en">which made Guan Fu angrier than ever.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-17a.44" xml:lang="en">When the party finally got started and the drinking had reached its height,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-17a.45" xml:lang="en">Guan Fu stood up and performed a dance, requesting the chancellor to follow with a dance of his own,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-17a.46" xml:lang="en">but Tian Fen merely sat where he was and refused to move.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-17a.47" xml:lang="en">Guan Fu then began to make insulting remarks from his seat</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-17a.48" xml:lang="en">until Dou Ying pulled him to his feet and hurried him out of the room,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-17a.49" xml:lang="en">apologizing to the chancellor for his behavior.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-17a.50" xml:lang="en">Tian Fen stayed and drank until evening when,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-17a.51" xml:lang="en">having enjoyed himself thoroughly, he took his leave.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-18a.2" xml:lang="en">Some time later, Tian Fen sent his retainer Ji Fu to ask Dou Ying if he would mind turning over to him some farm land south of the city which Dou Ying owned.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-18a.3" xml:lang="en">Dou Ying was furious when he heard the request.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-18a.4" xml:lang="en">"Though I am only an old man who has been abandoned by his friends</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-18a.6" xml:lang="en">he has absolutely no right to try to seize my possessions from me like this!</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-18a.7" xml:lang="en">I refuse to give up the land!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-18a.8" xml:lang="en">When Guan Fu heard of the incident</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-18a.9" xml:lang="en">he cursed Ji Fu roundly.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-18a.10" xml:lang="en">Ju Fu for his part was sorry to see enmity develop between Dou Ying and Tian Fen</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-18a.11" xml:lang="en">and so he did best to smooth over the affair,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-18a.12" xml:lang="en">returning to Tian Fen with excuses which he himself had invented.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-18a.13" xml:lang="en">"After all, Dou Ying is an old man and will die soon.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-18a.14" xml:lang="en">Surely you can do without the land for a while.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-18a.15" xml:lang="en">You had better wait a bit," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-18a.16" xml:lang="en">Later on, however, Tian Fen chanced to hear that Dou Ying and Guan Fu had in fact been greatly angered at his request and had refused to hand over the land,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-18a.17" xml:lang="en">whereupon he too became incensed.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-18a.18" xml:lang="en">"Once in the past Dou Ying's son killed a man</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-18a.19" xml:lang="en">but I managed to save him from punishment.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-18a.20" xml:lang="en">I have always treated Dou Ying with respect and done everything he has asked me to.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-18a.21" xml:lang="en">Why should he begrudge me a few acres of land?</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-18a.22" xml:lang="en">As for Guan Fu, what does he have to say in the matter?</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-18a.23" xml:lang="en">If that is the way they act, I will make no further requests for land!"</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-18a.24" xml:lang="en">Because of this Tian Fen came to bear a deep grudge against Guan Fu and Dou Ying.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-23a.8" xml:lang="en">After considering for some time, Han An-guo replied,</seg>

<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-24a.2" xml:lang="en">Shortly after, the emperor ordered the imperial secretary Han An-guo to draw up charges against Dou Ying,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-24a.14" xml:lang="en">Moreover, none of the officials dared make any further attempt to explain Dou Ying's position to the emperor.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-24a.15" xml:lang="en">Dou Ying therefore directed his brother's son to write a letter on his behalf</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_107-24a.16" xml:lang="en">to the emperor requesting that he be granted another audience.</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-17a.11" xml:lang="en">The other details of the envoy's reception Zhang Qian allowed to remain as before.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-17a.12" xml:lang="en">Zhang Qian then delivered his message, saying,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-17a.13" xml:lang="en">"If the Wusun will consent to move east</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-17a.14" xml:lang="en">and occupy the region of the Hunye king,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-17a.15" xml:lang="en">then the Han will send you a princess of the imperial family</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-17a.17" xml:lang="en">But the Wusun people were splitt into several groups</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-17a.18" xml:lang="en">and the king was old.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-17a.19" xml:lang="en">Living far away from China,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-17a.20" xml:lang="en">he had no idea how large the Han empire was.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-17a.21" xml:lang="en">Moreover, his people had for a long time in the past been subjects of the Xiongnu</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-17a.22" xml:lang="en">and still lived nearer to them than to China.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-17a.23" xml:lang="en">The high ministers of the king were therefore all afraid of the Xiongnu</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-17a.24" xml:lang="en">and did not wish to move back east.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-17a.25" xml:lang="en">Then king alone could not force his will upon his subjects,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-17a.26" xml:lang="en">and Zhang Qian was therefore unable to persuade him to listen to his proposal.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-17a.27" xml:lang="en">Kunmo had over ten sons,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-17a.29" xml:lang="en">who was very strong</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-17a.31" xml:lang="en">He lived in a seperate part of the realm</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-17a.32" xml:lang="en">and had over 10,000 horsemen under his command.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-17a.33" xml:lang="en">Dalu's older brother, who had been designated as heir to Kunmo,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-17a.35" xml:lang="en">The heir apparent died early</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-17a.36" xml:lang="en">and on his deathbed he begged his father, Kunmo,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-17a.38" xml:lang="en">"Do not allow anybody to take his position away from him!" he pleaded.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-17a.39" xml:lang="en">Kunmo, moved by grief, gave his permission</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-17a.40" xml:lang="en">and designated his grandson Cenqu as the new heir apparent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-17a.41" xml:lang="en">Dalu was furious that he himself had not been appointed heir and,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-17a.42" xml:lang="en">persuading his other brothers to join him,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-17a.43" xml:lang="en">led his forces in a revolt,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-17a.44" xml:lang="en">planning to attack Cenqi and Kunmo.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-17a.45" xml:lang="en">Kunmo, who was old</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-17a.46" xml:lang="en">and lived in the constant fear that Dalu would attack and kill his grandson,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-17a.47" xml:lang="en">gave Cenqu a force of over 10,000 horsemen</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-17a.48" xml:lang="en">and sent him to live in another part of the realm,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-17a.49" xml:lang="en">while he himself kept over 10,000 horsemen for his own protection.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-17a.50" xml:lang="en">Thus it happened that when Zhang Qian arrived the Wusun people</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-17a.51" xml:lang="en">were split into three factions,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-17a.52" xml:lang="en">though the large part of them acknowledged the leadership of Kunmo.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-17a.53" xml:lang="en">Kunmo for this reason</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-17a.54" xml:lang="en">did not dare make any promises to Zhang Qian on his own authority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-18a.2" xml:lang="en">Zhang Qian dispatched his assistant envoys to Dayuan,</seg>

<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-18a.5" xml:lang="en">the Wusun providing them with guides and interpreters.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-18a.6" xml:lang="en">Then he returned to China,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-18a.7" xml:lang="en">accompanied by twenty or thirty envoys from the Wusun</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-18a.9" xml:lang="en">which the Wusun sent in exchange for the Han gifts.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-18a.10" xml:lang="en">The Wusun envoys thus had an opportunity to see with their own eyes</seg>

</p>
<p>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-19a.3" xml:lang="en">Zhang Qian was honoured with the post of grand messenger,</seg>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-20a.10" xml:lang="en">It was Zhang Qian, however, who opened the way for this move,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-20a.11" xml:lang="en">and all the envoys who journeyed to the lands in later times</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-20a.12" xml:lang="en">relied upon his reputation</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-20a.13" xml:lang="en">to gain a hearing.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-20a.14" xml:lang="en">As a result of his efforts, the foreign states trusted the Han envoys.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-21a.2" xml:lang="en">After Zhang Qian's death</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-21a.3" xml:lang="en">the Xiongnu learned that the Han had established relations with the Wusun and,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-21a.4" xml:lang="en">infuriated by the news,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-21a.5" xml:lang="en">decided to make an attack on the Wusun.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-21a.6" xml:lang="en">By this time the Han had already sent envoys to the Wusun,</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-21a.9" xml:lang="en">and the Wusun, frightened by the threat of a Xiongnu attack,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-21a.10" xml:lang="en">sent an envoy with a gift of horses to the Han court</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-21a.13" xml:lang="en">The emperor referred the matter to his ministers for debate,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-21a.14" xml:lang="en">and they all replied,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-21a.21" xml:lang="en">When the Wusun came with their horses, which were of an excellent breed,</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-21a.23" xml:lang="en">Later, however, he obtained the blood-sweating horses from Dayuan,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-21a.25" xml:lang="en">He therefore changed the name of the Wusun horses,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.10" xml:lang="en">He dispatched a party of able young men and carriage masters</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.11" xml:lang="en">with 1,000 pieces of gold and a golden horse to go to the king of Dayuan</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.12" xml:lang="en">and ask him for some of the fine horses of Ershi.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.13" xml:lang="en">But Dayuan by this time was overflowing with Han goods,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.14" xml:lang="en">and the men of the state therefore plotted together, saying,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.15" xml:lang="en">"The Han is far away form us</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.16" xml:lang="en">and on several occasions has lost men in the salt-water wastes between our country and China</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.17" xml:lang="en">Yet if the Han parties go farther north, they will be harassed by the Xiongnu,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.18" xml:lang="en">while if they try to go south they will suffer from lack of water and fodder.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.19" xml:lang="en">Moreover, there are many places along the route</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.20" xml:lang="en">where there are no cities whatsoever</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.21" xml:lang="en">and they are apt to run out of provisions.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.22" xml:lang="en">The Han embassies that have come to us are made up of only a few hundred men,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.23" xml:lang="en">and yet they are always short of food</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.24" xml:lang="en">and over half the men die on the journey.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.25" xml:lang="en">Under such circumstances how could the Han</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.26" xml:lang="en">possibly send a large army against us?</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.27" xml:lang="en">What have we to worry about?</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.28" xml:lang="en">Furthermore, the horses of Ershi</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.29" xml:lang="en">are one of the most valuable treasures of our state!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.30" xml:lang="en">In the end, therefore, they refused to give the Han envoys any horses.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.31" xml:lang="en">Enraged,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.32" xml:lang="en">the Han envoys cursed the men of Dayuan,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.34" xml:lang="en">The nobles of Dayuan were furious,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.36" xml:lang="en">After the Han party had left, therefore,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.37" xml:lang="en">they sent orders to the people of Yucheng on the eastern border of the kingdom</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.39" xml:lang="en">and seize their goods.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.40" xml:lang="en">When the emperor received word of the fate of the envoys, he was in a rage.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.41" xml:lang="en">Yao Dinghan and others, who had acted as envoys to Dayuan in the past,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.42" xml:lang="en">assured the emperor that the kingdom was militarily weak</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.43" xml:lang="en">and that it would not require a force of more than 3,000 Han soldiers</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.45" xml:lang="en">to conquer it and take the entire population captive.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.46" xml:lang="en">Earlier, when the emperor had dispatched Zhao Ponu to attack Loulan,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.47" xml:lang="en">Zhao had led an advance party of only 700 horsemen</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.48" xml:lang="en">and had taken the king of Loulan prisoner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.49" xml:lang="en">The emperor therefore believed the assurances of Yao Dinghan and the others and,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.50" xml:lang="en">wishing to have some excuse to enfeoff the relatives of his favourite, Lady Li,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.51" xml:lang="en">he honoured her brother Li Guangli with the title of Ershi General</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.52" xml:lang="en">and dispatched him with a force of 6,000 horsemen recruited from the dependant states,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.53" xml:lang="en">as well as 20,000 or 30,000 young men of bad reputation rounded up from the provinces and kingdoms,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.54" xml:lang="en">to launch an attack on Dayuan.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.55" xml:lang="en">The title of Ershi General was given to Li Guangli because it was expected</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.56" xml:lang="en">that he would reach the city Ershi and capture the fine horses there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.57" xml:lang="en">Zhao Shicheng was appointed director of martial law for the expedition,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.58" xml:lang="en">and Wang Hui, the former marquis of Hao, was ordered to act as guide.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.59" xml:lang="en">Li Che was made a subordinate commander</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.60" xml:lang="en">and put in charge of various military affairs.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.61" xml:lang="en">This was in the first year of the taiyuan era (104 BC).</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-29a.63" xml:lang="en">and flew west as far as Dunhuang.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-30a.2" xml:lang="en">General Li and his army passed the Salt Swamp and were advancing west</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-30a.3" xml:lang="en">when they found that the inhabitants of the small states along theway,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-30a.5" xml:lang="en">had all shut themselves up tightly in their walled cities</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-30a.6" xml:lang="en">and refused to supply any food to the army.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-30a.7" xml:lang="en">Even attacks on the cities did not always prove successful.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-30a.8" xml:lang="en">The army was able to obtain provisions from some of the cities that submitted,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-30a.9" xml:lang="en">but in the case of others, if a few days of attack did not bring capitulation,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-30a.10" xml:lang="en">the army would move on its way.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-30a.11" xml:lang="en">Thus by the time Li Guangli reached Yucheng</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-30a.12" xml:lang="en">he had no more than a few thousand soldiers left,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-30a.13" xml:lang="en">and all of these were suffering of hunger and exhaustion.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-30a.14" xml:lang="en">He attacked Yucheng,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-30a.16" xml:lang="en">and a great many of his men were killed or wounded.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-30a.17" xml:lang="en">General Li then consulted with Li Che,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-30a.18" xml:lang="en">Zhao Shicheng, and his other officers and decided that,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-30a.19" xml:lang="en">if they could not even the city of Yucheng,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-30a.20" xml:lang="en">there was absolutely no hope that they could make a successful attack on Ershi, the king's capital, farther to the west.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-30a.21" xml:lang="en">They therefore decided to lead their troops back to China.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-30a.22" xml:lang="en">The journey to Dayuan and back had taken them two years,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-30a.23" xml:lang="en">and by the time they reached Dunhuang</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-30a.24" xml:lang="en">they had no more than one or two tenth of their original force left.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-30a.25" xml:lang="en">Li Guangli sent a messenger to the emperor explaining</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-30a.26" xml:lang="en">that the distance had been so great and he had been so short of provisions</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-30a.27" xml:lang="en">that his men, though brave enough in battle,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-30a.30" xml:lang="en">had survived the journey to make an attack on Dayuan possible.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-30a.31" xml:lang="en">He asked that the army be suspended for a while</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-30a.32" xml:lang="en">and a larger force recruited for another expedition later on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-30a.33" xml:lang="en">When the emperor received word of this,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-30a.34" xml:lang="en">he was enraged</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-30a.35" xml:lang="en">and sent an envoy with orders to close the pass at Jade Gate,</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-31a.2" xml:lang="en">This same summer</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-31a.3" xml:lang="en">over 20,000 Han soldiers under the command of Zhao Ponu</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-31a.5" xml:lang="en">The high ministers and court advisers all wanted</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-31a.8" xml:lang="en">But the emperor had already undertaken to punish Dayuan for its outrage</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-31a.9" xml:lang="en">and he was afraid that if his armies could not conquer even a small state like Dayuan,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-31a.10" xml:lang="en">then Daxia and the other lands would come to despise the Han.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-31a.11" xml:lang="en">No more fine horses could ever be obtained from Dayuan,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-31a.12" xml:lang="en">the Wusun and Luntou people would scorn and mistreat the Han envoys,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_123-31a.14" xml:lang="en">He therefore had Deng Guang and the others who were most outspoken in their opposition to the Dayuan compaign handed over to the law officials for investigation,</seg>

<p>

</p>
<p>

<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_124-1a.14" xml:lang="en">They studied books and cherished independence of action</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR2a0001_tls_124-1a.18" xml:lang="en">Therefore they lived all their lives</seg>
