<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-1a.3" xml:lang="en">The gentleman says:</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-1a.4" xml:lang="en">"In studying one must not stop."</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-1a.5" xml:lang="en">As for blue, one takes it from the indigo plant,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-1a.6" xml:lang="en">but it is bluer than the indigo plant.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-1a.7" xml:lang="en">As for ice, water produces/constitutes it,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-1a.8" xml:lang="en">but it is colder than water.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-1a.9" xml:lang="en">A piece of wood may be straight to fit the plumbline,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-1a.10" xml:lang="en">but it bends to become a wheel</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-1a.11" xml:lang="en">so that its roundness fits the compass.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-1a.12" xml:lang="en">The fact that even if (suīyǒu) it is dried out in the sun</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-1a.13" xml:lang="en">it will not be straightened out again</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-1a.14" xml:lang="en">is an effect of the bending.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-1a.15" xml:lang="en">Thus timber, if cut according to the plumbline, will be straight,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-1a.16" xml:lang="en">metal, if the whetst one is applied to it, will be sharp.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-1a.17" xml:lang="en">If the gentleman will study broadly</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-1a.18" xml:lang="en">and every day he keeps investigating himself,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-1a.19" xml:lang="en">then his awareness will be clear,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-1a.20" xml:lang="en">and his actions will be without inadvertent transgressions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-2a.2" xml:lang="en">Thus, if one does not climb a high mountain,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-2a.3" xml:lang="en">one will not understand the height of the sky;</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-2a.4" xml:lang="en">if one does not personally get into a deep gully (xī)</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-2a.5" xml:lang="en">one will not understand the thickness of the earth;</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-2a.6" xml:lang="en">if one has not heard-and-learnt the transmitted words of the former kings</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-2a.7" xml:lang="en">one does not understand the magnitude of study and inquiry.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-2a.8" xml:lang="en">The children of Wu and Yue, the Yi and the Mo</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-2a.9" xml:lang="en">make the same noises when they are born</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-2a.10" xml:lang="en">but as they grow up they have different customs.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-2a.11" xml:lang="en">Instruction brings this about.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-2a.12" xml:lang="en">The Songs [207] say:</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-2a.13" xml:lang="en">"Oh, you gentlemen,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-2a.14" xml:lang="en">do not constantly relax and rest.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-2a.15" xml:lang="en">Be poised and respectful in your positions</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-2a.16" xml:lang="en">and be fond of those who are correct and straight.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-2a.17" xml:lang="en">Then the spirits listen to you</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-2a.18" xml:lang="en">and they will assist you with great fortune."</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-2a.19" xml:lang="en">No spiritual force is greater than the transforming Way;</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-2a.20" xml:lang="en">good fortune lasts no longer than the period where there is no disaster.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-3a.2" xml:lang="en">One may try reflecting (on something) all day,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-3a.3" xml:lang="en">but that is not as good as what I have studied and learnt in a moment.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-3a.4" xml:lang="en">One may try standing on tip-toe and looking out for something,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-3a.5" xml:lang="en">but that is not as good as the broad view one gets when one climbs high.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-3a.6" xml:lang="en">When one climbs high and waves,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-3a.7" xml:lang="en">it is not that one's arms get longer,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-3a.8" xml:lang="en">but one sees further;</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-3a.9" xml:lang="en">if one shouts with the wind,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-3a.10" xml:lang="en">it is not that the sound is more intense,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-3a.11" xml:lang="en">but what is heard is clearer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-3a.12" xml:lang="en">As for someone who borrows a cart and a horse,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-3a.13" xml:lang="en">it is not that he gets quicker of foot,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-3a.14" xml:lang="en">but he covers a thousand li;</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-3a.15" xml:lang="en">and as for someone who borrows a boat and short oars,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-3a.16" xml:lang="en">it is not that gets better at swimming,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-3a.17" xml:lang="en">but he will (be able to) cross the Yangzi or the Yellow River.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-3a.18" xml:lang="en">From birth the gentleman is no different/remarkable,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-3a.19" xml:lang="en">but he is good at borrowing in relation to things.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-4a.2" xml:lang="en">In the southern regions there is a bird</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-4a.3" xml:lang="en">and its name is the Dull Dove:</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-4a.4" xml:lang="en">it makes its nest with feathers</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-4a.5" xml:lang="en">ties these toget her with hair</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-4a.6" xml:lang="en">ties them to reeds (wěi) and trumpet creeper (tiáo),</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-4a.7" xml:lang="en">but when the storm comes the trumpet creeper snaps,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-4a.8" xml:lang="en">(the Dull Dove's) eggs are smashed and its young die.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-4a.9" xml:lang="en">It is not that the nest was not accomplished,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-4a.10" xml:lang="en">but the point is what it was tied to.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-4a.11" xml:lang="en">In the West there was a tree</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-4a.12" xml:lang="en">and its name was Archery Trunk:</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-4a.13" xml:lang="en">its stem is four inches long</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-4a.14" xml:lang="en">but it grows on a high mountain</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-4a.15" xml:lang="en">and it looks down towards a 100 fathom deep abyss.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-4a.16" xml:lang="en">It is not that the stem of the tree was able to increase its length,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-4a.17" xml:lang="en">but the point it where it is established.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-4a.18" xml:lang="en">Bitter fleabane (péng) gr ows among the hemp,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-4a.19" xml:lang="en">and without support the bitter fleabane grows straight.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-4a.20" xml:lang="en">White sand in black earth</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-4a.21" xml:lang="en">will turn black together with it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-4a.22" xml:lang="en">When the root of the lán-"orchid" and the scholar tree make perfume,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-4a.23" xml:lang="en">but if one soaks them in urine,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-4a.24" xml:lang="en">then the gentleman will go nowhere near it</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-4a.25" xml:lang="en">and the ordinary person will not put it on.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-4a.26" xml:lang="en">It is not that the substance is not admirable,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-4a.27" xml:lang="en">but the point is what it was soaked in.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-4a.28" xml:lang="en">Therefore the gentleman, when it comes to a place to live,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-4a.29" xml:lang="en">will make a choice on the area,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-4a.30" xml:lang="en">and when it comes to travelling he will keep to men of the official class.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-4a.31" xml:lang="en">This is how he guards against wickedness and depravity</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-4a.32" xml:lang="en">and keeps close to moderate and correct.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-5a.2" xml:lang="en">For the emergence of the categories of things</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-5a.3" xml:lang="en">there is bound to be a beginning:original cause.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-5a.4" xml:lang="en">The advent of glory and disgrace</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-5a.5" xml:lang="en">is bound to be in accordance with the moral integrity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-5a.6" xml:lang="en">When meat has gone completely off it produces maggots;</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-5a.7" xml:lang="en">and when wood is rotten it produces worms.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-5a.8" xml:lang="en">If one is lazy and negligent and fails to pay proper attention to one's person</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-5a.9" xml:lang="en">then natural disasters will arise.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-5a.10" xml:lang="en">The strong choose their own support for strength,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-5a.11" xml:lang="en">and the weak choose their own fetters of weakness.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-5a.12" xml:lang="en">When there is wickedness and filth on the person</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-5a.13" xml:lang="en">that is what structures/forms resentment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-5a.14" xml:lang="en">If one lays out firewood evenly,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-5a.15" xml:lang="en">then the fire will go to the driest spot,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-5a.16" xml:lang="en">and if you level out the ground evenly,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-5a.17" xml:lang="en">then thw water will go to the wettest spot.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-5a.18" xml:lang="en">Shrubs and trees grow in clusters,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-5a.19" xml:lang="en">birds and beasts live in flocks.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-5a.20" xml:lang="en">Each kind of creature follows its natural kind.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-5a.21" xml:lang="en">Thus when the target is set,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-5a.22" xml:lang="en">then bows and arrows will get there;</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-5a.23" xml:lang="en">when the trees are flourishing,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-5a.24" xml:lang="en">then axes will get there;</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-5a.26" xml:lang="en">then crowds of birds will rest on them;</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-5a.29" xml:lang="en">Thus words will sometimes summon disaster,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-5a.30" xml:lang="en">and actions will sometimes summon personal humiliation.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-6a.1" xml:lang="en">The gentleman is careful about where he takes his stand.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-6a.2" xml:lang="en">If one amasses earth to make a hill,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-6a.7" xml:lang="en">then one will naturally achieve spiritual clarity</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-6a.8" xml:lang="en">and the mind-set of a sage will be complete.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-6a.9" xml:lang="en">Thus if one does not add up half-paces (kuǐ)</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-6a.10" xml:lang="en">one has no way of reaching a distance of 1000 li;</seg>

<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_001-6a.17" xml:lang="en">If in carving one will give up,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_018-1a.5" xml:lang="en">This is not so.</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_018-1a.10" xml:lang="en">If the tume of the singing master is inaudible, then the people have nothing to respond to.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_018-1a.11" xml:lang="en">if the gnomon is shrouded in darkness, then subordinates have nothing to act in accordance with.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_018-1a.12" xml:lang="en">If they do not respond and do not act according to the gnomon,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_018-1a.13" xml:lang="en">then superior and inferior will have no means of relying upon each other.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_018-1a.14" xml:lang="en">If such a situation should obtain,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_018-1a.17" xml:lang="en">Thus the superior is the root and the foundation for his subordinates.</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_018-1a.37" xml:lang="en">If they are suspicious and confused, they are difficult to unify.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_018-1a.44" xml:lang="en">'Accordingly, the way of the ruler benefits from clarity and not from obscurity;</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_018-1a.46" xml:lang="en">Thus, if the way of the ruler is clear, his subjects will be calm and feel secure;</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_018-1a.56" xml:lang="en">Thus, no way of the ruler is so fraught with evil as that of being difficult to know;</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_018-12a.30" xml:lang="en">or considering that they desire sex and beauty, yet despise Xi Shi.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_018-13a.2" xml:lang="en">The ancients thought otherwise:</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_018-13a.3" xml:lang="en">they considered that from his essential nature man's desires were numerous, not few.</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_019-1a.3" xml:lang="en">How did ritual principles arise?</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_019-1a.4" xml:lang="en">I say</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_019-1a.5" xml:lang="en">that men are born with desires</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_019-1a.6" xml:lang="en">which, if not satisfied,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_019-1a.7" xml:lang="en">cannot but lead men to seek to satisfy them.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_019-1a.8" xml:lang="en">If in seeking to satisfy their desires men observe no measure and apportion things without limits,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_019-1a.9" xml:lang="en">then it would be impossible for them not to contend over the means to satisfy their desires.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_019-1a.10" xml:lang="en">Such contention leads to disorder.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_019-1a.11" xml:lang="en">Disorder leads to poverty.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_019-1a.12" xml:lang="en">The Ancient Kings abhorred such disorder;</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_019-1a.13" xml:lang="en">so they established the regulations contained within ritual and moral principles in order to apportion things,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_019-1a.14" xml:lang="en">to nurture the desires of men,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_019-1a.15" xml:lang="en">and to supply the means for their satisfaction.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_019-1a.16" xml:lang="en">They so fashioned their regulations that the desires should not want for the things which satisfy them</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_019-1a.17" xml:lang="en">and goods would not be exhausted by the desires.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_019-1a.18" xml:lang="en">In this way the two of them, desires and goods, sustained each other over the course of time.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_019-1a.19" xml:lang="en">This is the origin of ritual principles.</seg>

<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_019-2a.15" xml:lang="en">There are the harmonious sounds of the tinkling bells on the horse's trappings;</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_019-2a.32" xml:lang="en">Accordingly, if one acts with only preservation of his own life in view,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_019-2a.40" xml:lang="en">Thus, if a man concentrates single-mindedly on ritual and moral principles,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_019-2a.42" xml:lang="en">but if he concentrates solely on his inborn desires and emotions,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_019-3a.1" xml:lang="en">Such is the distinction between the Ru and the Mohists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_019-3a.2" xml:lang="en">Ritual principles have three roots.</seg>

<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_019-3a.17" xml:lang="en">Thus, rituals serve Heaven above</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_019-4a.9" xml:lang="en">But the sacrifice at the end of mourning extends even to the knights and grand officers.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_019-4a.10" xml:lang="en">These serve to distinguish between the noble</seg>

<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_019-4a.14" xml:lang="en">Hence, the ruler of the empire serves seven generations in his sacrifices;</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_020-1a.16" xml:lang="en">Thus they instituted as regulations the sounds of the Odes and the Hymnes to offer guidance.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_020-1a.17" xml:lang="en">This would cause the sounds to be sufficient to give expression to the joy, but not lead to dissipation .</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_020-1a.19" xml:lang="en">It would casue the intricacy or directness of melody, the elaboration or simplification of instrumentation, the purity or richness of sound,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_020-1a.20" xml:lang="en">and the rhytm and meter of the music to be sufficient to stir and move the good in men's hearts</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_020-1a.21" xml:lang="en">and to keep evil and base qi sentiments from finding a foothold there.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_020-1a.22" xml:lang="en">Such was the plan of the Ancient Kings in establishing their music.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_020-2a.2" xml:lang="en">Hence, when music is performed within the ancestral temple,</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_020-2a.11" xml:lang="en">Hence, for musical performance the pitch of the prime note is set in order to determine the proper pitch of the other notes.</seg>

<p>

<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_020-3a.7" xml:lang="en">When we observe the ranks move within the borders of fixed areas</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_020-3a.9" xml:lang="en">the arrangement of our own ranks is corrected</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_020-3a.11" xml:lang="en">Thus, in musical performances, the ranks moving forward is the way to suggest punitive expeditions and punishing offenders</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_020-3a.12" xml:lang="en">and their stepping back the way to suggest saluting and yielding.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_020-3a.13" xml:lang="en">The intent of punitive expeditions and punishing offenders</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_020-3a.14" xml:lang="en">is one and the same as saluting and yielding in musical performances.</seg>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_020-4a.2" xml:lang="en">Further, musical performances were what the Ancient Kings used to exhibit their delight.</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_020-4a.5" xml:lang="en">Both delight and anger of the Ancient Kings obtained equal and uniform expression in this way.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_020-4a.6" xml:lang="en">For this reason, when they showed delight, the whole world joined with them,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_020-4a.7" xml:lang="en">and when they showed anger the violent and rebellious were filled with fear.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_020-4a.8" xml:lang="en">It is precisely in their ritual and music</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_020-4a.9" xml:lang="en">that the Way of the Ancient Kings has its highest expression.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_020-4a.10" xml:lang="en">Yet Mozi condemns it.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_020-4a.11" xml:lang="en">Thus, I say that Mozi's understanding of the Way</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_020-4a.12" xml:lang="en">is like that of a blind man trying to distinguish white from black,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_020-4a.13" xml:lang="en">or of a deaf man bass and treble notes</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_020-4a.14" xml:lang="en">or like someone who tries to reach Chu (in the south) by traveling to the north.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_020-5a.2" xml:lang="en">The influence of music and sound on man is very profound,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_020-5a.3" xml:lang="en">and the transformations they produce in him can be very rapid.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_020-5a.4" xml:lang="en">Thus, the Ancient Kings were assiduous in creating proper forms.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_020-5a.5" xml:lang="en">If music accords exactly with the mean and is evenly balanced, the people will be harmonious and not given to dissipation.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_020-5a.6" xml:lang="en">If it is solemn and dignified, then the people will behave in a uniform manner and will not be inclined to disorder.</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_020-5a.16" xml:lang="en">Such is the beginning of the true kingship.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_020-5a.17" xml:lang="en">If music spoils and seduces toward wickedness,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3a0002_tls_020-5a.18" xml:lang="en">then the people will become dissipated and indolent and will be mean-spirited and base.</seg>
