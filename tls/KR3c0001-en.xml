<seg corresp="#KR3c0001_tls_001-8a.8" xml:lang="en">Righteousness consists in not pushing oneself forward [at the expense of others].</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR3c0001_tls_001-8a.10" xml:lang="en">Having a sense of shame consists in not following those who go awry.</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR3c0001_tls_001-12a.10" xml:lang="en">Therefore punishment alone is not enough to terrify9 the minds [of the people],</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0001_tls_001-12a.11" xml:lang="en">nor is killing sufficient to make their hearts submissive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0001_tls_001-13a.2" xml:lang="en">Thus, if punishments are numerous yet the minds of the people are not terrified,</seg>
