<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-2a.2" xml:lang="en">This may be so,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-2a.3" xml:lang="en">but I hope to speak up on everything I have learnt,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-2a.4" xml:lang="en">and it is up to the Great King apportion the crimes of which I am thereby guilty.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-3a.2" xml:lang="en">I have learnt:</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-3a.3" xml:lang="en">all the states, Yān in the north and Wèi in the south,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-3a.4" xml:lang="en">have linked up with Chǔ and bolstered up their relations with Qí</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-3a.5" xml:lang="en">and they have taken in Hán to create a vertical (north/south) alliance.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-3a.6" xml:lang="en">They are all set to face westwards to create difficulties for powerful Qín.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-3a.7" xml:lang="en">I permit myself to laugh at them.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-3a.8" xml:lang="en">In this world there are three kinds of ruinous conditions,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-3a.9" xml:lang="en">and the whole world has got to the point of having all three:</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-3a.10" xml:lang="en">Probably that is a point relevant to the present situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-4a.2" xml:lang="en">I have heard:</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-4a.3" xml:lang="en">"If using chaos one attacks good order,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-4a.4" xml:lang="en">if with wickedness one attacks correctness,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-4a.5" xml:lang="en">if with recalcitrance one attacks obedience, one will be ruined."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-5a.2" xml:lang="en">Now the civil and military storehouses in the world are not full</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-5a.3" xml:lang="en">and the granaries are all empty.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-5a.4" xml:lang="en">But they have taken out all their citizens,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-5a.5" xml:lang="en">and they have lined up an overall armed force of up to a million men.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-5a.7" xml:lang="en">Those who kow-tow, put on feather head-dress to become generals and who profess to be determined to to die in the front line,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-5a.8" xml:lang="en">are more than one thousand men.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-5a.9" xml:lang="en">But they all die in words only.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-5a.10" xml:lang="en">When the white blades are out up front</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-5a.11" xml:lang="en">and the axes and chopping blocks are behind their backs,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-5a.12" xml:lang="en">then on the other hand they turn round and run away, unable to risk their lives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-6a.2" xml:lang="en">It is not that the citizens are unable to face death.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-6a.3" xml:lang="en">The reason is that the leadership is basically incompetent .</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-6a.4" xml:lang="en">When they propose rewards they do not deliver them,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-6a.5" xml:lang="en">when they propose punishments they do not carry them out,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-6a.6" xml:lang="en">and rewards and punishments are not reliable</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-6a.7" xml:lang="en">so that the citizens are not in a position to face death.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-7a.2" xml:lang="en">Now Qín promulgates announcements and orders and is carrying out rewards and punishments.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-7a.3" xml:lang="en">Recognition for achievements or lack of recognition are according to actual service.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-7a.4" xml:lang="en">From the time people here emerge from their parents' bosom</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-7a.5" xml:lang="en">all their lives they have simply never seen an enemy of the state.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-7a.6" xml:lang="en">But when they hear there is war</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-7a.7" xml:lang="en">they stamp their feet and demonstratively take off their upper garments,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-7a.8" xml:lang="en">they rush against white blades,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-7a.9" xml:lang="en">they tread on glowing coals</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-7a.10" xml:lang="en">and they are determined to face death in the forefront:</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-7a.11" xml:lang="en">this is all because of this policy of statutes and the rewards and punishments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-8a.2" xml:lang="en">There is a big difference between being determined to face death and to live,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-8a.3" xml:lang="en">and the reason why the people do this</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-8a.4" xml:lang="en">is because they value fighting until death highly.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-8a.5" xml:lang="en">One man fighting until death is able to fend off ten of the enemy,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-8a.6" xml:lang="en">ten are able to fend off one hundred,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-8a.7" xml:lang="en">one hundred re able to fend off one thousand,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-8a.8" xml:lang="en">one thousand can fend off ten thousand,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-8a.9" xml:lang="en">and ten thousand can win against the whole world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-9a.2" xml:lang="en">Now as for Qín, if you give and take a little,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-9a.3" xml:lang="en">is several thousand square lǐ large,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-9a.4" xml:lang="en">its renowned armed hosts are counted by the hundred thousands.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-9a.5" xml:lang="en">As for the public orders and ordinances, rewards and punishments of Qín,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-9a.6" xml:lang="en">the strategic advantages and dangerous points in the territory,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-9a.7" xml:lang="en">there is no one in the world who can match the state of Qín.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-10a.2" xml:lang="en">If one takes this state and contrasts it with the rest of the world,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-10a.3" xml:lang="en">then the rest of the world is not even worth combining under one's sway.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-10a.4" xml:lang="en">Therefore Qín, whenever it launches into a battle, never fails to win,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-10a.5" xml:lang="en">and when it launches an attack it never fails to take the object of that attack;</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-10a.6" xml:lang="en">whomever she faces she never fails to destroy,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-10a.7" xml:lang="en">and as a result it has expanded its territory by several thousand square lǐ.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-10a.8" xml:lang="en">This is its great achievement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-11a.2" xml:lang="en">And yet, arms and armour have no edge,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-11a.3" xml:lang="en">the citizens are sickly,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-11a.4" xml:lang="en">accumulated supplies are exhausted,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-11a.5" xml:lang="en">fields lie fallow,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-11a.6" xml:lang="en">granaries stand empty,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-11a.7" xml:lang="en">the neighbouring feudal lords in all four directions do not submit,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-11a.8" xml:lang="en">and the name of a leading king has not been established.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-11a.9" xml:lang="en">For this there is no other reason:</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-11a.10" xml:lang="en">all the advising ministers do not fully do their best for the ruler.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-12a.2" xml:lang="en">I venture to declare:</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-12a.3" xml:lang="en">In the past Qí ruined Chǔ in the south,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-12a.4" xml:lang="en">it ruined Sòng in the east,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-12a.5" xml:lang="en">subjected Qín in the west,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-12a.6" xml:lang="en">ruined Yān in the north,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-12a.8" xml:lang="en">and controlled Hán and Wèi in the central region.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-12a.9" xml:lang="en">Its territories were enlarged and its armed forces were strengthened,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-12a.10" xml:lang="en">in battles it won, and in attacks it took the target,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-12a.11" xml:lang="en">and it gave orders to all under Heaven.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-13a.2" xml:lang="en">The clear Jì river and the murky Yellow River in the state of Qí</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-13a.3" xml:lang="en">served well as blocking borders;</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-13a.4" xml:lang="en">a long wall and gigantic dikes</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-13a.5" xml:lang="en">served well as blocks against an enemy.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-13a.6" xml:lang="en">As for Qí</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-13a.7" xml:lang="en">she is a state that has won five major battles.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-13a.8" xml:lang="en">But in one battle it did not prevail, and Qí was no more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-14a.2" xml:lang="en">Viewed from this point of view.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-14a.3" xml:lang="en">warfare</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-14a.4" xml:lang="en">involves the survival or ruin of large and powerful states.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-14a.5" xml:lang="en">Moreover, I have learnt:</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-14a.6" xml:lang="en">"When one cuts down a tree trunk one should not leave any roots;</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-14a.7" xml:lang="en">one should not court disaster,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-14a.8" xml:lang="en">then there will be no source of disaster"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-15a.2" xml:lang="en">When Qín went to war against the leadership of Chǔ,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-15a.3" xml:lang="en">and they greatly defeated Chǔ,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-15a.4" xml:lang="en">they invaded the capital Yǐng,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-15a.7" xml:lang="en">they took Dòngtíng, Wǔhú, and Jiāngnán.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-15a.8" xml:lang="en">The king of Chǔ, ruler and ministers, went into exile,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-15a.9" xml:lang="en">and he submitted to find refuge in Chén, towards the east.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-16a.2" xml:lang="en">At this time,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-16a.3" xml:lang="en">if one had pursued Chǔ with armed force,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-16a.4" xml:lang="en">then it would have been possible to conquer Chǔ.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-16a.5" xml:lang="en">If it had been possible to conquer Chǔ</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-16a.6" xml:lang="en">then its population would have been worth seeking profit from</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-16a.7" xml:lang="en">and its territory would have been worth deriving revenues from.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-16a.8" xml:lang="en">In the east one would have been able to weaken Qí and Yān,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-16a.9" xml:lang="en">in the centre one could in that way have dominated the Three Jìn.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-17a.2" xml:lang="en">And so, at one stroke, in this way,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-17a.3" xml:lang="en">one's fame as a leading king could have been established,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-17a.4" xml:lang="en">the feudal lords from the neighbouring states could have been made to come to our court.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-17a.5" xml:lang="en">But this is what the advising ministers did not do.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-17a.6" xml:lang="en">They lead the troops into retreat,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-17a.7" xml:lang="en">and they went on to make peace with the people of Chǔ.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-18a.2" xml:lang="en">They caused the people of Chǔ to regain their lost country,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-18a.3" xml:lang="en">to gather again the scattered people,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-18a.4" xml:lang="en">to establish a lord of the altar of land and grain,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-18a.5" xml:lang="en">to establish the ancestral temples.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-18a.6" xml:lang="en">They caused them to lead all under Heaven to direct their attention to the west</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-18a.7" xml:lang="en">and thus to make trouble for Qín.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-18a.8" xml:lang="en">This certainly was the first lost opportunity for leadership.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-19a.2" xml:lang="en">The whole world again ganged up and encamped at Huáxià,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-19a.3" xml:lang="en">the Great King had already issued orders to rout them,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-19a.4" xml:lang="en">the armed forces had arrived below the outer city walls of Liáng.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-19a.5" xml:lang="en">If one had surrounded Liáng for several ten-day weeks,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-19a.6" xml:lang="en">then it would have been possible to take Liáng;</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-19a.7" xml:lang="en">if one had captured Liáng</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-19a.8" xml:lang="en">then Wèi could have been taken;</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-19a.9" xml:lang="en">once one had taken Wèi,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-19a.11" xml:lang="en">then the political designs of Chǔ and Zhào would have been thwarted;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-20a.2" xml:lang="en">Once the political designs of Chǔ and Zhào were thwarted,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-20a.3" xml:lang="en">then Zhào would have been in a precarious position.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-20a.4" xml:lang="en">Zhào would have been in a precarious state, and Chǔ deeply uncertain.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-20a.6" xml:lang="en">In the east one could thus have weakened Qí and Yān,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-20a.7" xml:lang="en">and in the central region one could thus have exerted pressure on the Three Jìn states.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-20a.8" xml:lang="en">And so at one stroke one could have established one's name as the leading king,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-20a.9" xml:lang="en">all the neighbouring feudal lords could be made to come to court.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-21a.2" xml:lang="en">But the advisers did not do this.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-21a.3" xml:lang="en">They lead the army into retreat,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-21a.4" xml:lang="en">again they made peace with the Wèis.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-21a.5" xml:lang="en">They caused the Wèis to reassemble their lost state,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-21a.6" xml:lang="en">to re-gather the scattered people,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-21a.7" xml:lang="en">to establish a ruler for the altars of land and grain,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-21a.9" xml:lang="en">They caused Wèi to lead the world to face west and make trouble for Qín.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-21a.10" xml:lang="en">This certainly was the second way in which the leadership of kings was lost.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-22a.2" xml:lang="en">Quite some time ago when Marquis Xiāng governed Qín</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-22a.4" xml:lang="en">and tried to accomplish achievements for a pair of states.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-22a.5" xml:lang="en">And so the soldiers spent all their lives exposed out in the open country</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-22a.6" xml:lang="en">the citizens were worn out and sick in the capital,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-22a.7" xml:lang="en">the reputation of a leader of kings was not established.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-22a.8" xml:lang="en">This certainly was the third lost opportunity of establishing the name of a leader.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-23a.2" xml:lang="en">The Zhàos</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-23a.3" xml:lang="en">are a central state,</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-24a.2" xml:lang="en">Those are certainly the features of a state doomed to ruin,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-24a.4" xml:lang="en">They encamped all their citizens below the walls of Chángpíng</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3c0005_tls_001-24a.5" xml:lang="en">in order to fight for Shàngdǎng in Hán.</seg>
