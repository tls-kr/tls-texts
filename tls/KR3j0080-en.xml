<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-2a.6" xml:lang="en">this is a case where men differing in conduct still served the same lord.</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-2a.8" xml:lang="en">and there is also the possibility of either meeting or not meeting right opportunity.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-2a.9" xml:lang="en">Such was the case for Yī Yín and Jī Zí.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-2a.10" xml:lang="en">Yī Yǐn and Jī Zǐ possessed the same talent,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-2a.12" xml:lang="en">and Jī Zǐ a slave.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-2a.13" xml:lang="en">This was because Yī Yǐn happened to meet Tāng the Successful,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-2a.14" xml:lang="en">and Jī Zǐ happened to meet Zhòu of the Shāng dynasty.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-2a.15" xml:lang="en">Now if, as a talented person one serves a talented ruler,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-2a.16" xml:lang="en">and the ruler wishes to practise good government</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-2a.17" xml:lang="en">and if the minister supports him with his talents,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-2a.18" xml:lang="en">and their choices in action coincide,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-2a.19" xml:lang="en">then it is only to be expected that he meets with success;</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-2a.20" xml:lang="en">if, as a talented person one serves a bad ruler</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-2a.21" xml:lang="en">and the ruler does not wish to practise good government,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-2a.22" xml:lang="en">and if as a minister one aids him through loyal behaviour,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-2a.23" xml:lang="en">and their conduct and aspirations are in conflict with each other,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-2a.24" xml:lang="en">it is surely only to be expected that he does not meet with success.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-3a.2" xml:lang="en">Sometimes as a superbly distinguished minister</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-3a.3" xml:lang="en">one comes across a ruler wishing to conduct proper government</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-3a.4" xml:lang="en">but in the end somehow does not meet success.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-3a.5" xml:lang="en">Such was the case of Confucius and Mencius.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-3a.6" xml:lang="en">Confucius was short of provisions between Chén and Cài,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-3a.7" xml:lang="en">Mencius got into trouble in Qí and Wèi.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-3a.8" xml:lang="en">It was not that the rulers did not employ qualified persons;</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-3a.9" xml:lang="en">it was rather that their talents were of a low order and their understanding shallow,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-3a.10" xml:lang="en">and that they thus were unable to employ men of great talent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-3a.11" xml:lang="en">Now anyone able to steer a Jì Lù steed</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-3a.12" xml:lang="en">must be a Wáng Liáng.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-3a.13" xml:lang="en">Anyone able to use an Yǔ, a Jì or a Gāo Yáo as minister</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-3a.14" xml:lang="en">must be a Yáo or a Shùn.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-3a.15" xml:lang="en">A hand able to control a horse that runs a hundred lǐ a day</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-3a.16" xml:lang="en">to try controlling the feet of a horse capable of running a thousand lǐ a day</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-3a.17" xml:lang="en">is sure to suffer disasters such as that of broken yokes.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-3a.18" xml:lang="en">If someone with a talent sufficient for handling fill-in ministers</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-3a.19" xml:lang="en">uses this to keep under control the wisdom of great ministers</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-3a.20" xml:lang="en">then he is bound to encounter emergencies that will cause his mind to go blank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-3a.21" xml:lang="en">Thus when perfect proposals are rejected</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-3a.22" xml:lang="en">and men of excellence is repudiated</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-3a.23" xml:lang="en">this is not because rulers hate men of excellence,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-3a.24" xml:lang="en">or because they have no taste for perfect proposals.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-3a.25" xml:lang="en">The point is that men of excellence aim high</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-3a.26" xml:lang="en">and perfect proposals are hard to put into practice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-3a.27" xml:lang="en">Now, when a person of great talent seeks employment with a person of small talent,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-3a.28" xml:lang="en">then the person of small talent will not be able to accept this,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-3a.29" xml:lang="en">and not meeting with success is only to be expected.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-4a.2" xml:lang="en">Sometimes when as a minister of great talent,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-4a.3" xml:lang="en">meets a ruler of great talent,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-4a.4" xml:lang="en">it is only then that the possibility arises both for meeting and not meeting with success.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-4a.5" xml:lang="en">Shùn and Xǔ Yóu, Tài Gōng and Bó Yí2 are cases in point.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-4a.7" xml:lang="en">Shùn and Xǔ Yóu were both sages,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-4a.12" xml:lang="en">Tài Gōng and Bó Yi were both worthies,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-4a.13" xml:lang="en">rose together in the kingdom of Zhōu,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-4a.14" xml:lang="en">and both had audiences with King Wú3.</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-4a.16" xml:lang="en">while Bó Yì starved to death.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-4a.17" xml:lang="en">As to men of excellence, their way was the same, their aspirations convergent, and their choices were along the same lines,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-4a.18" xml:lang="en">but the actions of Yú Shùn and Tài Gōng were matching,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-4a.19" xml:lang="en">and the conduct of Xú Yóu and Bó Yì was at odds with each other,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-4a.20" xml:lang="en">they were not born in the proper age,</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-4a.27" xml:lang="en">Ways may be subtle or coarse</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-4a.28" xml:lang="en">aspirations may be pure or impure.</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-4a.30" xml:lang="en">was an assistant to an August One,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-4a.41" xml:lang="en">That is why [these two ministers] did not meet with the right opportunities.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-4a.42" xml:lang="en">Actually, Yáo was less than spotless, and Shùn had dirty hands,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_001-4a.43" xml:lang="en">King Wǔ, in his punishments, was cruel;</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_028-2a.36" xml:lang="en">so his shallow statements became more profound,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_028-2a.39" xml:lang="en">Gāo Yáo's explanations became focussed, and they became more profound and incisive.</seg>

</p>
<p>

<p>

<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_028-4a.3" xml:lang="en">is not a matter of a lack of talent.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_028-4a.4" xml:lang="en">The hard part lies in keeping one's master at bay (and not allowing oneself to be intellectually subjugated),</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR3j0080_tls_028-4a.5" xml:lang="en">in regarding the Way(truth of a matter) as essential, and rectitude as the substantial issue,</seg>
