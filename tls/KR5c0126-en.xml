<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-17a.31" xml:lang="en">Such were the sayings which the rhetoricians used in answer to Hui Shih,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-17a.32" xml:lang="en">rambling on without stop till the end of their days.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.2" xml:lang="en">Huan Tuan and Kung-sun Lung were among such rhetoricians.29</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.3" xml:lang="en">Dazzling men's minds,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.4" xml:lang="en">unsettling their views,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.5" xml:lang="en">they could outdo others in talking,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.6" xml:lang="en">but could not make them submit in their minds -</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.7" xml:lang="en">such were the limitations of the rhetoricians.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.8" xml:lang="en">Hui Shih day after day used all the knowledge he had in his debates with others,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.9" xml:lang="en">deliberately thinking up ways to astonish the rhetoricians of the world -</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.10" xml:lang="en">the examples above will illustrate this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.11" xml:lang="en">Nevertheless, Hui Shih's manner of speaking</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.12" xml:lang="en">showed that he considered himself the ablest man alive.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.14" xml:lang="en">"Heaven and earth - perhaps they are greater!" he used to declare.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.15" xml:lang="en">All he knew how to do was play the hero; he had no real art.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.16" xml:lang="en">In the south there was an eccentric</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.17" xml:lang="en">named Huang Liao</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.18" xml:lang="en">who asked why Heaven and earth do not collapse and crumble,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.19" xml:lang="en">or what makes the wind and rain, the thunder and lightning.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.20" xml:lang="en">Hui Shih, undaunted, undertook to answer him; without stopping to think,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.21" xml:lang="en">he began to reply,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.22" xml:lang="en">touching upon every one of the ten thousand things in his peroration,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.23" xml:lang="en">expounding on and on without stop</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.24" xml:lang="en">in multitudes of words that never ended.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.25" xml:lang="en">But still it was not enough,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.26" xml:lang="en">and so he began to add on his astonishing assertions.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.27" xml:lang="en">Whatever contradicted other men's views he declared to be the truth,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.28" xml:lang="en">hoping to win a reputation for outwitting others.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.29" xml:lang="en">This was why he never got along with ordinary people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.30" xml:lang="en">Weak in inner virtue,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.31" xml:lang="en">strong in his concern for external things,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.32" xml:lang="en">he walked a road that was crooked indeed!</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.33" xml:lang="en">If we examine Hui Shih's accomplishments from the point of view of the Way of Heaven and earth,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.34" xml:lang="en">they seem like the exertions of a mosquito or a gnat -</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.35" xml:lang="en">of what use are they to other things?</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.36" xml:lang="en">True, he still deserves to be regarded as the founder of one school,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.37" xml:lang="en">though I say,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.38" xml:lang="en">if he had only shown greater respect for the Way,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.39" xml:lang="en">he would have come nearer being right.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.40" xml:lang="en">Hui Shih, however, could not seem to find any tranquillity for himself in such an approach.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.41" xml:lang="en">Instead he went on tirelessly separating and analyzing the ten thousand things,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.42" xml:lang="en">and in the end was known only for his skill in exposition.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.43" xml:lang="en">What a pity -</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.44" xml:lang="en">that Hui Shih abused and dissipated his talents</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.45" xml:lang="en">without ever really achieving anything!</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.46" xml:lang="en">Chasing after the ten thousand things, never turning back,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.47" xml:lang="en">he was like one who tries to shout an echo into silence</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.48" xml:lang="en">or to prove that form can outrun shadow.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR5c0126_tls_033-18a.49" xml:lang="en">How sad!</seg>
