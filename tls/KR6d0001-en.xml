<seg corresp="#KR6d0001_T_001-0002b.31" xml:lang="en">and everywhere the Buddha world quaked and trembled in six different ways.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR6d0001_T_001-0002b.32" xml:lang="en">"At that time the monks, nuns, laymen and laywomen ,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR6d0001_T_001-0002b.33" xml:lang="en">heavenly beings, dragons, yakshas, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kimnaras, and mahoragas, the human and nonhuman beings in the assembly,</seg>

<seg corresp="#KR6d0001_T_001-0002b.35" xml:lang="en">all those in this great assembly gained what they had never had before and,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR6d0001_T_001-0002b.36" xml:lang="en">filled with joy, pressed their palms together and gazed at the Buddha with a single mind.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR6d0001_T_001-0002b.37" xml:lang="en">At that time the Buddha emitted a ray of light from the tuft of white hair between his eyebrows, one of his characteristic features,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR6d0001_T_001-0002b.38" xml:lang="en">lighting up eighteen thousand worlds in the eastern direction.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR6d0001_T_001-0002b.39" xml:lang="en">There was no place that the light did not penetrate,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR6d0001_T_001-0002b.40" xml:lang="en">reaching downward as far as the Avichi hell</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR6d0001_T_001-0002b.41" xml:lang="en">and upward to the Akanishtha heaven.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR6d0001_T_001-0002b.42" xml:lang="en">From this world one could see the living beings in the six paths of existence in all of those other lands.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR6d0001_T_001-0002b.43" xml:lang="en">One could likewise see the Buddhas present at that time in those other lands</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR6d0001_T_001-0002b.44" xml:lang="en">and could hear the sutra teachings which those Buddhas were expounding.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR6d0001_T_001-0002b.45" xml:lang="en">At the same time one could see the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen who had carried out religious practices and attained the way.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR6d0001_T_001-0002b.46" xml:lang="en">One could also see the bodhisattvas and mahasattvas who, through various causes and conditions and various types of faith and understanding and in various forms and aspects were carrying out the way of the bodhisattva.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR6d0001_T_001-0002b.47" xml:lang="en">And one could also see the Buddhas who had entered parinirvana,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR6d0001_T_001-0002b.48" xml:lang="en">towers adorned with the seven treasures were erected for the Buddha relics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR6d0001_T_001-0002b.49" xml:lang="en">At that time the Bodhisattva Maitreya had this thought:</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR6d0001_T_001-0002b.50" xml:lang="en">Now the World-Honored One has manifested these miraculous signs.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR6d0001_T_001-0002b.51" xml:lang="en">But what is the cause of these auspicious portents?</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR6d0001_T_001-0002b.52" xml:lang="en">Now the Buddha, the World Honored One, has entered into samadhi.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR6d0001_T_001-0002b.53" xml:lang="en">An unfathomable event such as this is seldom to be met with.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR6d0001_T_001-0002b.54" xml:lang="en">Whom shall I question about this?</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR6d0001_T_001-0002b.55" xml:lang="en">Who can give me an answer?</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR6d0001_T_001-0002b.56" xml:lang="en">And again he had this thought:</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR6d0001_T_001-0002b.57" xml:lang="en">this Manjushri, son of a Dharma King,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR6d0001_T_001-0002b.58" xml:lang="en">has already personally attended and given offerings to immeasurable numbers of Buddhas in the past.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR6d0001_T_001-0002b.59" xml:lang="en">Surely he must see these rare signs.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR6d0001_T_001-0002b.60" xml:lang="en">I will now question him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR6d0001_T_001-0002c.1" xml:lang="en">At this time the monks, nuns, laymen and laywomen,as well as the heavenly beings, dragons, spirits, and the others all had this thought:</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR6d0001_T_001-0002c.3" xml:lang="en">this beam of brightness from the Buddha, these signs of transcendental powers -</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR6d0001_T_001-0002c.4" xml:lang="en">now whom shall we question about them?</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR6d0001_T_001-0002c.5" xml:lang="en">At that time Bodhisattva Maitreya wished to settle his doubts concerning the matter.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR6d0001_T_001-0002c.6" xml:lang="en">And in addition he could see what was in the minds of the four kinds of believers, the monks, nuns, laymen and laywomen,　as well as the heavenly beings, dragons, spirits and the others who made up the assembly.</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR6d0001_T_001-0002c.7" xml:lang="en">So he questioned Manjushri, saying,</seg>
<seg corresp="#KR6d0001_T_001-0002c.8" xml:lang="en">"What is the cause of these auspicious portents, these signs of transcendental powers,</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg corresp="#KR6d0001_T_005-0042c.35" xml:lang="en">"Because living beings have different natures, different desires, different actions,</seg>
